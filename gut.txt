                      dorothy dales great secret




                               chapter i
                           an automobile ride


there is one thing perfectly delightful about boarding schools
declared tavia when the term closes we can go away and leave it in
another world now at dalton we would have to see the old schoolhouse
every time we went to dalys for a pound of butter a loaf of bread and
oh yes i almost forgot mom said we could get some bologna whew dont
your mouth water dorothy we always did get good bologna at dalys

bologna echoed dorothy as if the young ladies of glenwood school
would disgrace their appetites with such vulgar fare

at this she snatched up an empty cracker box almost devouring its
parifine paper in hopes of finding a few more crumbs although tavia had
poured the last morsels of the wafers down her own throat the night
before this conversation took place yes tavia had even made a funnel of
the paper and took the powdered biscuits as doctors administer headache
remedies

all the same went on tavia i distinctly remember that you had a
longing for the skin of my sausage along with the end piece which you
always claimed for your own share

oh please stop besought dorothy or i shall have to purloin my hash
from the table tonight and stuff it into 

the armlet of your new brown kid gloves finished tavia theyre the
very color of a nice big redbrown bologna and i believe the
inspiration is a direct message the evolution of a bologna sausage
modern edition bound in full kid mine for the other glove watch all
the hash within sight tonight and well ask the girls to our
clambake

dear old dalton went on dorothy with a sigh after all there is no
place like home and she dropped her blond head on her arms in the
familiar pose tavia described as thinky

but home was never like this declared the other following up
dorothys sentiment with her usual interjection of slang at the same
moment she made a dart for a tiny bottle of dorothys perfume which was
almost emptied down the front of tavias blue dress before the owner of
the treasure had time to interfere

oh thats mean exclaimed dorothy aunt winnie sent me that by mail
it was a special kind 

and you know my weakness for specials real bargains there and tavia
caught dorothy up in her arms ill rub it all on your head tresses of
sunshine perfumed with incense

please stop begged dorothy my hair is all fixed

well its fixest now the superlative you know i do hate your hair
prim never knew a girl with heavenly hair who did not want to make a
mattress of it i have wonderfully enhanced the beauty of your coiffure
mamselle for which i ask to be permitted one kiss and at this the two
girls became so entangled in each others embrace that it would have been
hard to tell whom the blond head belonged to or who might be the owner
of the bronze ringlets

but dorothy dale was the blond and octavia travers sported the dark
tresses sported we say advisedly for tavia loved sport better than
she cared for her dinner while dorothy an entirely different type of
girl admired the things of this world that were good and beautiful true
and reliable but at the same time she was no prude and so enjoyed her
friends sports whenever the mischief involved no serious consequences

that doro as her chums called dorothy and tavia could be so unlike
and yet be such friends was a matter of surprise to all their
acquaintances but those who have read of the young ladies in the
previous stories of the series dorothy dale a girl of today and
dorothy dale at glenwood school have had sufficient introduction to
these interesting characters to understand how natural it was for a lily
our friend dorothy to love and encourage a frolicsome wild flower
tavia to cling to the cultured stalk to keep close to the saving
influence of the lilys heart so close that no gardener would dare to
tear away that wild flower from the lilys clasp without running the
risk of cruelly injuring the more tender plant

so it was with these two girls no one could have destroyed their love
and friendship for each other without so displacing their personalities
as to make the matter one of serious consequences

many other girls had coveted dorothys love some had even tried to
obtain it by false stories or greatly exaggerated accounts of tavias
frolics but dorothy loved tavia and believed in her so all attempts to
destroy her faith were futile and it was this faith when the time came
that inspired dorothy dale to keep the great secret

glenwood school was situated amid the mountains of new england and the
two girls had completed one term there on the afternoon when this story
opens they were lounging in their own particular room nineteen by
number waiting for the recreation bell to send its muffled chimes down
the corridor

they were waiting with unusual impatience for the hour of freedom to
come for they expected visitors in an automobile

like as not tavia broke in suddenly without offering a single excuse
for the surprising interjection the fire bird will break down and we
wont get our ride after all

cheerful speculation interposed dorothy but not exactly probable
the fire bird is an auto that never breaks down

what never persisted tavia laughing

no never declared dorothy of course all automobiles are subject to
turns but to really break down aunt winnie would never allow her boys to
run a machine not entirely reliable

ooooh drawled tavia in mock surprise then the girls settled down
to wait

the fire bird was a touring car in which the girls had enjoyed some
noted rides about their home town of dalton dorothys aunt mrs
winthrop white of north birchland owned the car and her two sons
edward and nathaniel or ned and nat to give them the titles they always
went by good looking young fellows were usually in charge of it when
their favorite cousin dorothy and her friend tavia were the other
passengers

it may as well be stated at this time that nat and tavia were excellent
friends and even on a ride that had been termed notorious on account of
the strange experiences that befell the party while making a tour tavia
and nat had managed to have a good time and made the best of their
strange adventures

it was not surprising then that on this afternoon while dorothy and
tavia waited for another ride in the fire bird their brains should be
busy with speculative thoughts tavia was sure nat would think she had
grown to be a real young lady and dorothy was so anxious to see both her
cousins that she fell to thinking they might have outgrown the jolly
bigboy relationship and would come to her stiff and stylish young men

the peal of the recreation bell in the outer hall suddenly aroused the
girls and at the same moment the honkhonk of the fire birds horn
announced the arrival of the long expected boys

there they are exclaimed tavia quite unnecessarily for dorothy was
already making her pearltinted veil secure over her yellow head and
while tavia was wasting her time looking out of the window at the auto
which was surrounded by boys and girls who stood on the path plainly
admiring the two cousins and the stylish car dorothy was quite ready for
the ride

do come tavia she called the afternoon is short enough

com ing shouted her irrepressible companion in high glee making a
lunge for her own veil and tossing it over her head as she dashed down
the corridor

dorothy stopped at the office on her way out to tell the principal mrs
pangborn that the expected visitors had arrived and that she and tavia
were starting for the ride permission to go having been granted in
advance

outside just beyond the arch in the broad driveway the fire bird panted
and puffed as if anxious to take flight again ned was at the steering
wheel and as for nat he was helping tavia into the machine with both
hands some jealous onlookers declared afterward however dorothys
friend rosemary markin known to her chums as cologne because of her
euphonious first names insisted differently in the argument that
followed the puffing away of the car

it was no small wonder that the coming of the fire bird should excite
such comment among the girls at glenwood school an automobile ride was
no common happening there for while many of the parents of the young
ladies owned such machines glenwood was far away from home and so were
the autos

edna black called ned ebony and regarded as tavias most intimate
friend insisted that tavia looked like a little brown sparrow as she
flew off with the streamers of her brown veil flying like wings molly
richards nicknamed dick and always agin th government like the
foreigner in politics declared that the girls were not in it with the
boys for as she expressed it girls always do look like animated
ragbags in an automobile

boys just put themselves on the seat and stay put she announced but
girls they seem to float above the car and they give me the shivers

all the same interrupted cologne the damsels manage to hang on

and dorothy was a picture ventured nita brant the girl given to
excessive expletive ejaculations according to the records of the nick
association the official club of the juniors

so the fire bird with its gay little party flew over the hills of
glenwood dorothy was agreeably surprised to find her cousins just as
good natured and just as boylike as they had been when she had last seen
them and they in turn complimented her on her improved appearance

you look younger though you talk older ned assured dorothy with a
nice regard for the feminine feeling relative to age

and tavia looks looks how stammered nat with a significant look at
his elder brother

search me replied the other evasively determined not to be trapped by
nat into any expert opinion

beyond words finished nat with a glance of unstinted admiration at
his companion

bad as that mocked tavia the girls do call me red head and
bricktop yes even carroty is thrown at me when i do anything to
make ned mad you know thats the girl she hurried to add the
girl edna black ned ebony for short you know shes the jolliest crowd 

how many of her asked ned pretending to be ignorant of tavias school
vernacular

legion was the enthusiastic answer which elastic comment settled the
question of edna black for the time being at least

the roads through glenwood wound up and down like thread on a spool
scarcely did the fire bird find itself on the top of a hill before it
went scooting down to the bottom then another would loom up and it had
to be done all over again

this succession of steep grades first tilting up and then down kept ned
busy throwing the clutches in and out taking the hills on the low gear
then slipping into full speed ahead as a little level place was reached
and again throwing off the power and drifting down while the brakes
screeched and hummed as if in protest at being made to work so hard the
two girls meanwhile were busy speculating on what would happen if an
something should give way or if the powerful car should suddenly
refuse to obey the various levers handles pedals and the maze of things
of which ned seemed to have perfect command

this reminds me of the switchback railway remarked nat as the
machine suddenly lurched first up and then down a rocky bump

yyyes agreed ned shouting to be heard above the pounding of the
muffler its quite like a trip on the scenic railway pretty pictures
and all

i hope it isnt dangerous ventured dorothy who had too vivid a
remembrance of the narrow escape on a previous ride to enjoy the
possibility of a second adventure

no danger at all ned hastened to assure her

a long hill at last exclaimed nat as the big strip of brown earth
uncoiled before them like so many miles of ribbon dropped from the sky
with a knot somewhere in the clouds a long hill for sure none of your
dinky little twoforacent kinds this time

oh gasped dorothy involuntarily catching at neds arm be careful
ned

ned took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as he finished throwing out
the gear and shutting off the power while the spark lever sent out a
shrill sound as he swung it in a segment over the rachet

the hill was not only remarkably steep but consisted of a series of
turns and twists down the grade the car plunged in spite of the brakes
that ned jammed on with all his force to prevent a runaway he was a
little pale but calm and with his steady hands on the wheel clinging
firmly to it in spite of the way it jerked about as if trying to get
free he guided the fire bird down the big machine swerving from right
to left but ever following where the lad directed it

as they swung around a turn in the descending road a clump of trees
obstructed the view for a moment then the car glided beyond them
gathering speed every moment in spite of the brakes

the creek yelled tavia in sudden terror pointing to where a small
but deep stream flowed under the road theres the creek and the bridge
is broken

the water was spanned by a frail structure generally out of order and in
a state of uncertain repair it needed but a glance to show that it was
now in course of being mended for there was a pile of material near it
work however had been temporarily suspended

then there flashed into view a warning signboard announcing that the old
planking of the bridge had been taken up to allow the putting down of
new and that the bridge was impassable the four horrorstricken
occupants of the car saw this at a glance

stop the car cried tavia

cant answered ned hoarsely ive got the emergency brake on but it
doesnt seem to hold

its all right called nat i saw a wagon go over the bridge when we
were on our way to the school this afternoon

but it crossed on some loose narrow planks tavia gasped i saw them
put the boards there yesterday when we were out for our walk i forgot
all about them oh stop the car we cant cross on the planks well all
be killed

ned leaned forward pulling with all his strength on the brake handle as
if to force it a few more notches back and make the steel band grip
tighter the whirring wheels that were screeching out a shrill protest at
the friction

i i cant do it he exclaimed almost in a whisper

the fire bird was dashing along the steep incline ned clung firmly to
the steering wheel for though there was terrible danger ahead it was
also close at hand should the auto swerve from the path his face was
white and nats forced breathing sounded loud in the ears of the
terrorstricken girls

the bridge was but a few hundred feet away the auto skidded along as if
under power though the gasolene was shut off

theres a plank across the entrance maybe that will stop us cried
nat

never in this world replied ned in despairing tones

dorothy was sending up wordless prayers but she did not stir from her
seat sitting bravely still and not giving way to useless terror nor
did tavia once the first shock was over for she saw how quiet dorothy
was and she too sank back among the cushions waiting for the crash she
felt would soon come

if some boards are only down murmured ned maybe i can steer 

the next instant the fire bird had crashed through the obstruction plank
it splintered it as if it were a clothes pole and a moment later
rumbled out upon the frail loose planking laid lengthwise across the
floorless bridge as a path for the repair teams

oh oh shrieked the two girls in one breath

nat jumped up from his seat and leaning forward grasped his brother by
the shoulders

then what followed was always a mystery to the four who had an
involuntary part in it the front wheels took the narrow planks and
clung there as ned held the steering circle steady there was a little
bump as the rear wheels took the same small boards there was a crashing
splintering sound and then before any of those in the car had a chance
to realize it the fire bird had whizzed across the bridge and was
brought to a quick stop on the other side

whew gasped ned as he tried to open the paralyzed hands that seemed
grown fast to the steering wheel

look at that cried nat as he leaped from the car and pointed back
toward the bridge we broke two planks in the very middle and only the
fast rate we clipped over them saved us from going down

what an escape cried tavia as she jumped from her seat

is the car damaged asked dorothy as she too alighted to stand beside
her chum

something happened to the radiator when we hit the rail and broke it
said ned as he saw water escaping from the honeycomb reservoir but i
guess it wont amount to much it isnt leaking badly the idea of the
county having a picture bridge over a river why theres a swift current
here and its mighty deep just look at that black whirlpool near the
eddy if wed gone down there what the machine left of us would have been
nicely cooled off at any rate

the two boys were soon busy examining the car while dorothy and tavia
stood in the road

wasnt it dreadful exclaimed dorothy i do believe we ought not to go
auto riding something happens every time we go out

and to think that i knew about the bridge whispered tavia only
yesterday i saw it and noticed how unsafe it was then i forgot all about
it oh dorothy if anything had happened it would have been my fault




                               chapter ii
                            tavia has plans


dorothy threw her arms about tavia and for a few moments the two girls
were locked in each others embrace the reaction following their lucky
escape from almost certain death had unnerved them nor were the two
boys altogether free from a shaky feeling as they carefully looked over
the car to see if it had suffered any further damage than the leaky
radiator

think shell do asked nat

guess so replied his brother my but that was as close a call as i
have ever had

me too i guess wed better take a breathing spell before we go on

the boys sat down on a grassy bank and the girls followed their example
they looked back over the bridge and at the two broken planks that had
nearly proved their undoing through the spaces where the flooring was
torn up the black swirling waters could be seen

while the auto party are resting until they have somewhat gotten over the
fright caused by their narrow escape let me tell something of dorothy
and her friends as set forth in the first book of this series dorothy
dale a girl of today the girl was the daughter of major frank dale a
veteran of the civil war he ran a weekly newspaper called the bugle
in dalton a small town in new york state dorothys mother had died some
years previous the girl had two brothers younger than herself named
joe and roger

dorothy took part in a temperance crusade in dalton and had much to do in
unraveling the mystery of an unfortunate man given to drink he left a
small fortune to his daughter whose whereabouts were unknown and
dorothy succeeded in finding her in her work the girl was much hampered
by a man named anderson who sought to do her bodily harm and who was at
the bottom of the mystery concerning the daughter of the unfortunate man

dorothy proved herself a brave girl and with the help of tavia who
became her especial chum did much to aid several persons in dalton

in the second volume dorothy dale at glenwood school there i related
how dorothy and her father came upon better days major dale fell heir to
quite a sum of money and could give up the newspaper

dorothy was sent to glenwood school where tavia accompanied her the two
girls had many exciting times there and dorothy was suspected of
something for which she was not to blame suffering much in consequence
of her desire to shield another girl there was much fun at the school
in spite of this however including a queer walking match and a strange
initiation

dorothy and her father moved to north birchland the home of mrs
winthrop white mr dales sister anderson the man who had caused
dorothy so much trouble turned up again but was eventually sent to jail

after the holidays dorothy and tavia returned to school where we find
them at the opening of this story they had become friends of nearly all
the students though as is natural had made some enemies as what girl
does not

now the party on the roadside prepared to start off again

i cant forgive myself for not remembering about the dangerous state of
the bridge went on tavia when ned and nat had announced that the auto
was fit to continue its journey

of course it wasnt your fault said dorothy

yes it was insisted tavia you wouldnt have forgotten it doro
dear

and to give dorothy credit she would not have been so thoughtless but
she was a different type of girl from tavia it was the way she had been
brought up as much as her own character that caused this difference
good breeding is not a virtue it is a blessing hence in considering
such a gift we admire the fortunate possessor just as we esteem the
beauty of the cultured rose and naturally compare it favorably when
placed next to some coarse untrained wild flower

so it was with our two friends dorothy and tavia dorothy was well bred
and could always be relied upon for the good breeding was nicely coupled
with a kindness of heart that composed a charming character though
dorothy had no mother her aunt mrs winthrop white almost filled that
place in the girls heart

the white family with whom dorothy her father and two brothers had gone
to live since the advent of the legacy consisted of mrs white and her
two sons nat and ned mr white had died some years ago while engaged
in a scientific expedition

not having a daughter of her own dorothys aunt winnie was especially
fond of her pretty niece and as the girl could barely remember her own
mother she lavished her affection on her fathers sister

dorothys affection love and devotion to her father was of a different
type from that given to any other living creature not excepting her own
darling brothers joe and roger and roger had almost grown up in his
sisters arms for he had been a tiny baby when his mother was called
away

it was in dalton that dorothy had met and learned to love tavia the
travers family of whom tavia was the most interesting member lived not
far from the dale homestead tavia had grown up with dorothy as her most
intimate friend and companion and it was dorothys love for tavia that
had wrought miracles for the girl who lacked proper home training for
her parents were of that class generally designated as improvident

tavia always ignored the saving rules of correct society and being
naturally bright and strangely pretty was now that she was in her
fifteenth year in a fair way to be spoiled by those who delighted to
hear her witty nonsense and who looked upon her frolics as entertaining
in an otherwise stupid old world

well shall we go along now asked ned as he again took his place at
the steering wheel

yes but go slow begged tavia we can go home by a different road we
have lots of time before we have to be back to glenwood school for tea

slow it is replied ned not at all sorry that he could take it easy
after the strenuous time dorothy had many questions to ask her
cousins all about her fathers rheumatism whether the electric treatment
was doing him as much good as the doctors had promised how her brothers
were getting on at school how strange it seemed to have roger at
school and scores of other things but she always came back to her
father or the boys to roger she could scarcely imagine her baby brother
running home to aunt winnie with his book under his arm

while ned and dorothy were thus busy with family affairs nat and tavia
seated on the rear seat were discussing purely personal matters nat
told of the tour he and his brother had made from north birchland the
trip being undertaken with other members of a club which was holding a
meet not far from glenwood school tavia found plenty of small
interesting talk to give and take with nat

dorothy she asked suddenly do you think we could get off all day
tomorrow and take a run out to where the auto meet is being held it
would be all sorts of fun and 

tomorrow echoed dorothy why you know we have our english exams and
our geometry to make up besides mrs pangborn would never allow us to
go to a boys camp

allow us just as if we were in the kindergarten lets make up some
excuse and go now doro dont look so shocked surely you have the
right to go out with your own cousins

tavia dont talk such nonsense exclaimed dorothy severely you know
perfectly well we are under the school rules and that we are in honor
bound not to violate them as if any sensible girl would risk her good
standing for such an escapade

whats the standing at glenwood compared to the sitting in the fire
bird asked tavia flippantly besides just think of all the jolly
fellows we would meet wouldnt we nat

theres a great collection of wild ducks out there at the auto camp
nat answered rather reluctantly for he plainly saw that tavias
surprising proposition had caused dorothy serious annoyance

well ive a mind to go myself will you come for me boys i could
disappear at class hour when all the tattletales will be sure to be
busy scheming out of their work then i could get back in time to have
my head tied up at lunch hour headache all the morning you know
simplest thing in the world

even the boys scarcely smiled as tavia unfolded a possible plan to
deceive her teachers and to dishonor her own name her friends were well
accustomed to her pranks and prattle and usually regarded her nonsense
as mere babble but somehow tavia was growing up lately and it
seemed quite time for her to take life more seriously

tavia spoke up dorothy finally you came to glenwood upon my aunts
recommendation and under my 

wing broke in tavia throwing her arms out toward the slender form of
the girl seated ahead of her in the auto

at any rate finished dorothy im perfectly sure that my cousins will
never take part in any such nonsense

oh mr flea youve bitten me and you must die sang tavia making a
series of melodramatic gestures that caused the boys to laugh and even
made dorothy smile in forgiveness

thus are my social ambitions nipped in the bud extinguished in their
first faint gleaming went on tavia assuming a tone of tragedy well
my fairygodmother dorothy dale glenwood when that day comes that i am
forced to spurn the lines of the social swim and you find me beyond the
ropes clinging helplessly to the tailend of my former prestige carried
out with the great surging tide of struggling humanity then you will
remember that i had attempted a correct debut and it ended in a splash
of dale indignation

somehow tavias nonsense had a ring of reality today perhaps it was the
narrow escape at the bridge that had tinted her pictures with such a
serious tone she seemed preoccupied and gave her chatter in words
contradicted by her voice and manner it was some minutes before any one
spoke all appeared to be enjoying the valedictory and presently
tavia promising to turn over a new leaf made a grab for a branch of a
tree the auto just then passed under and swished the foliage she
captured until every leaf showed its silvery underside against the deep
blue sky she laughed at her joke

of course you know said ned as he swung the car into a crossroad
that led to glenwood mother expects you to come to north birchland
with dorothy this summer tavia well try to make you comfortable ahem
nat has a brand new tandem besides white duck duds to burn 

nixy to wear corrected his brother mother says white ducks are
economical for man and beast

of course youll come with me tavia said dorothy noting instantly
that her chum had not responded to the kind invitation that nat had
delivered for his mother

perhaps replied tavia vaguely

are you going to spend all your time at dalton continued dorothy much
puzzled at tavias manner

oh no indeed answered tavia promptly this time showing plainly
that she had other plans than those connected with her home town

i hope youll come said nat aside in pardonable earnestness for his
good times with the little bronze beauty of dalton were cherished
among his very best memories tavia was certainly a jolly girl and nat
liked her why should he not like her

oh ill be sure to see you tavia answered nat

sure to see him yes but she little dreamed then how very glad she would
be to see him and what serious happenings were to take place before that
meeting




                              chapter iii
                              a cup of tea


dorothy began tavia that evening as the two girls sat alone in their
room enjoying their usual goodnight conference why couldnt you take
that spin out to the auto meet it would be no end of good fun

fun echoed dorothy surprised that tavia should again venture to
propose such a thing why tavia really you shock me then she went to
the little dresser under pretext of looking for something but in
reality to gain time she scarcely knew what to say to her chum whose
sudden whim was so startling

tavia sat on the box divan her hands in her lap and her brown head bent
over a strange and serious attitude for the girl who was never known to
sit still even in church and who had the reputation of being the
jolliest girl at glenwood for some moments she appeared to be
unconscious of dorothys presence so absorbed was she in her own
thoughts dorothy was now regarding her curiously what could have turned
tavias head for turned from its usually bright and happy line of
thought it plainly was

what is it tavia she asked finally stealing up to the crouched
figure and placing her arm gently about her chums neck

why inquired the other with a sudden start as if afraid dorothy
would divine her thoughts

you are worried about something come tell me what it is

worried tavia jumped up shaking off dorothys arm worried dorothy
dale i believe youre not well you act morbid creepy

dorothy turned away she was hurt crushed that tavia should spurn her
affection and refuse her confidence

we always told each other everything and dorothy almost sighed as her
words came slowly and with strange coldness i never imagined you would
keep any important secret from me

you silly exclaimed tavia throwing her arms around dorothy this time
who said i had a secret what in the world has put that wild notion into
your yellow head bless it

this last expression brought a kiss to the golden ringlets and as the
two girls sat there dorothy with a faraway look in her eyes that were
clouded with unbidden tears tavia with her cheek pressed lovingly
against the blond head and her own eyes looking into some unknown
future their pose was like a stage picture the kind usually presented
when one sister is about to leave a country home and the other bids her
stay

arent we a couple of jays broke in tavia as soon as she appeared to
realize the melodramatic effect i declare we ought to travel as the
glum sisters mag and liz there wouldnt we make a hit for teary ones
weeps are in great demand they say smiles are being overworked in the
profresh and she strode up to the mirror with a most selfsatisfied
glance at her pretty face

tavia you are getting awfully big for slang it seems more like sneering
than joking exclaimed dorothy and ive been wanting to say that to
you some of the other girls have noticed it they say you act more like a
chorus girl than a glenwood pupil of course i dont want to hurt your
feelings but i thought it would be better for me to tell you than for
you to hear it from some one else

chorus girl thanks no need to apologize i assure you thats from
silly little nita brandt i suppose well better to act like a chorus
girl than a fool blurted out tavia with a show of temper and any
silly girl who can not keep things to herself well i always thought
nita was a featherhead and now i know it

oh indeed it was not nita dorothy hastened to assure her it was at
the lawn tea the other day you were acting dont you remember doing
that funny toe dance you are always trying lately

ooooh and tavia made a queer little pout and a very funny face
so they appreciated my maiden effort eh i am indeed flattered tell
the girls im much obliged and ill see that they get passes for the
initial performance tell them also to have the bouquets tagged its so
annoying to have a great stack of please accepts to answer with the
superscriptions cut out so to speak i know all the girls will send
pansies they are so sweet and would make such wicked faces for the girls
who could not conveniently present their own adorable phizes

what in the world are you talking about asked dorothy who had been
listening to the outburst with a queer idea that all this stage business
was not mere idle chatter that there might be a reason for tavias
cynicism

talking about auto rides quietly answered tavia recovering herself
with an effort wasnt that a dandy this afternoon and to think we
might have missed that horatius at the bridge business if i had been
silly enough to mention that the planking was gone

dont talk of it exclaimed dorothy shuddering i cannot bear to
think of what might have happened and tavia you must not think i have
adopted the lecture platform for good but i must say it was careless of
you not to mention about the bridge especially as you knew what a hill
led down to it and how the fire bird can cover hills

of course you know i entirely forgot it doro and now tavia showed
some remorse at the reprimand

my theres the bell exclaimed dorothy as a clang sounded down the
corridor i had no idea it was so late and she jumped up to disrobe
quick or miss higley will see our light

let her answered tavia indifferently i dont feel very well and
would just love something warm say a nice little cup of tea 

a tap at the door interrupted her remarks dorothy jumped into a large
closet and tavia calmly opened the portal

it was miss higley the second assistant teacher with rather a
forbidding expression on her wrinkled face and who among the girls
bore a reputation characterized as sour

why is this she demanded stepping in and brushing tavia aside

i was just thinking of calling you answered tavia clapping her hand
to her waist line i have such a dreadful oh dear and she sat down
without further explanation

do you need anything asked miss higley her tone more kindly

oh no certainly not sighed tavia i would not trouble you but if i
might have a sip of tea that tea you brought dorothy did her so much good
the other night

she paused to allow a proper expression of agony to spread over her face
and gently rubbed her hand over the region covered by her belt

i suppose you made that tea yourself didnt you it was so good
dorothy told me

that settled it for any one to praise miss higleys brew so few persons
really do appreciate a good cup of tea as usual tavia had won out

why of course ill get you a cup i have just made a small pot i felt
rather rather tired myself i dont as a rule drink tea at night but i
was not altogether well where is dorothy

just slipping on a robe with a glance at the closet where her chum was
concealed im afraid i disturbed her went on tavia glibly

well ill get the tea miss higley remarked as she started to leave
the room ill bring the pot here and we can take it together

quick called tavia to dorothy as the door closed slip on your robe
tea with higley of all the doins and she promptly turned a somersault
on the hitherto unrumpled bed wont the girls howl i do hope she
brings biscuits there get down your box you precious miser just think
of crackering higley

dorothy appeared dumfounded it had all been arranged so quickly and
there was miss higley back again she carried a tray with a small china
teapot and three blue cups to match

i thought dorothy might like a cup she remarked in a sort of
apologetic way there now as tavia and dorothy relieved her of the
tray it will be pleasant to have a sip together of course we would not
do it but for octavias illness tavia looked to be in dreadful pain at
that moment but since we have to give her a cup of tea we may as well
make a virtue of necessity

it is very kind of you miss higley dorothy said rather hesitatingly
im sure that we that is i i mean tavia should not have put you to all
this trouble but of course one cant help being ill she hastened to
add for she felt she was rather giving tavias secret away

it really is too bad to make all this fuss the supposed sufferer
interjected you went to a lot of trouble for me miss higley and i
appreciate it very much and tavia winked the eye next to dorothy but
concealed the sign from the sight of the instructress tavia was trying
hard not to laugh and her repressed emotion shook the tray to the no
small danger of upsetting the teapot cups and all

i never consider my duty any trouble answered miss higley seeming to
feel the obligation of being dignified in fact it did not occur to her
just then that she was doing a most unprecedented thing taking tea with
two school girls and after hours at that however she had committed
herself and now there was no way out dorothy presented her package of
chocolate crackers and miss higley took some while tavia arranged the
tea tray on the little table

surely the scene was mirthprovoking dorothy in her pretty blue robe
tavia with her hair loose collar off and shoes unlaced and miss higley
prim as ever in her brown mohair with the long black cord on her
glasses there the three sat sipping tea and making eyes too full
for utterance as tavia would say

such lovely tea dorothy managed to gulp out at the risk of allowing
her mouth to get loose in a titter once the tight line of silence was
broken

then all at once they stopped drinking some one was coming down the
hall miss higley arose instantly the gentle tap on the door was
answered by tavia

mrs pangborn

oh she apologized i did not mean to disturb a little social tea do
sit down honorah to miss higley im very glad to see you enjoying
yourself and mrs pangborn meant what she said

oh indeed i merely came to administer to a sick girl octavia was
suddenly taken with cramps

mrs pangborn glanced at tavia

but that cup of tea has made me feel so much better declared dorothys
roommate with that kind of truth that mere words make the kind that
challenges falsehood

i am always glad to see you looking after the girls honorah went on
the principal but i am equally glad to see you consider yourself im
sure you have a perfect right to take a cup of tea here my dear to
dorothy perhaps you have a sip left

dorothy found there was another cup of the beverage still warm in the
little teapot and this she poured into her own pink and white china cup
for mrs pangborn

miss higley remained standing seemingly too abashed to move

do finish yours said tavia pushing the empty chair toward the
embarrassed teacher

but tavias mirth showed through her alleged illness and miss higley
began to feel that she had been imposed upon

if you if you will excuse me she stammered

oh do finish your tea begged mrs pangborn and so the severe little
teacher was obliged to sit down again

an hour later tavia was still trying to untwist her kinks as she
described her attacks of muffled laughter

oh wasnt it gloriotious she exclaimed to think i couldnt get a
single twinge in my entire system if i only could put that sort of a
cramp in alcohol wouldnt it be an heirloom to glenwood

please do stop pleaded dorothy from under her quilt the next time
they may bring a doctor and a stomach pump and if you dont let me go to
sleep i do believe i will call her

you dare to and ill get something dreadfully contagious so you will
have to be disinfected and isolated but higley the terrible the abused
little squintyeyed tattletale oh when mrs pangborn said she was glad
to see her enjoying herself that persecuted saint enjoying herself
didnt she look the part

but even such mirth must succumb to slumber when the victim is young and
impressionable so with yawns and titters tavia finally quieted down to
sleep




                               chapter iv
                             the apparition


it seemed to dorothy that she had scarcely closed her eyes when she was
startled by someone moving about the room she sat up straight to make
sure she was not dreaming and then she saw a white object standing
before the mirror

a beam of moonlight glimmered directly across the glass and dorothy
could now see that the figure was tavia

surmising that her companion had merely arisen to get a throat lozenge
for she had been taking them lately dorothy did not speak expecting
tavia to return to her bed directly

but the girl stood there so long and so still that dorothy soon called to
her

what is the matter tavia she asked

oh nothing returned the other without looking around

but what are you doing

making up and dorothy could see her daubing cold cream over her face

still convinced that tavia was busy with some ordinary toilet operation
as she had of late become very particular about such matters dorothy
turned over and closed her eyes but she could not sleep something
uncanny seemed to disturb her every time she appeared to be dropping off
into a doze

finally she sat up again there was tavia still before the mirror
daubing something over her face

tavia called dorothy sharply what in the world are you doing

making up replied tavia a second time and without moving from her
original position

making up surely she was spreading cold cream and red crayon dust all
over her face had she lost her mind

for an instant dorothy stood watching her but tavia neither spoke nor
turned her head

tavia she called taking hold of the hand that held the red chalk
dorothy noticed that tavias palm and fingers were cold and clammy and
tavias eyes were open though they seemed sightless dorothy was
thoroughly frightened now should she call someone miss higley had
charge of that wing of the school and perhaps would know what to do but
dorothy hesitated to make a scene tavia was never ill and if this was
only some queer spell it would not be pleasant to have others know about
it

then feeling intuitively that this making up should not be made a
public affair dorothy determined to get tavia back into her own bed

are you ill she asked rubbing her own hand over her companions
greasy forehead

ill no indeed tavia replied as mechanically as she had spoken
before still she smeared on the cold cream and red crayon

come commanded dorothy and to her amazement the girl immediately
laid down the box of cream and the stick of chalk while dorothy led her
to the bed and helped her to make herself comfortable on the pillows

then dorothy quietly went to the dresser and lighted a tiny candle
carrying it over to tavias bedside

peering anxiously into her face she found her roommate sleeping and
breathing naturally there was no evidence of illness and then for the
first time it occurred to dorothy that tavia had been walking in her
sleep and makingup in her sleep

what could it mean

how ghastly that hideous color and the streaks made tavias face appear

and as dorothy sat beside the bed gazing into that besmeared face
while the flicker of the little candle played like a tiny limelight over
the girls cruelly changed features a strange fear came into dorothys
heart

after all was tavia going to disappoint her would she fail just when
she seemed to have turned the most dangerous corner in her short
career that of stepping from the freedom of girlhood into the more
dignified realm of youngladyship and would she always be just ordinary
tavia travers always of contradictory impulses was she never to be
relied upon never to become a wellbred girl

tavia turned slightly and rubbed her hand across her face she seemed to
breathe heavily dorothy thought and as she touched tavias painted
cheek she was certain it was feverish with that promptness of action
that had always characterized dorothys work in real emergencies she
snatched the cold cream from the dresser where tavia had left it and
with deft fingers quickly rubbed a generous supply over the face on the
pillows

although tavia was waking now dorothy was determined if possible to
remove all traces of the red paint before tavia herself should know that
it had been on her cheeks briskly but with a hand gentle and calm
dorothy rubbed the cream off on her own linen handkerchief taking the
red mixture with it nothing was now left on tavias face but a thin
coating of the cold cream that could tell no tales

tavia turned to dorothy and opened her eyes

what what is the matter she asked like one waking from a strange
dream

nothing dear answered dorothy but i guess you had some night
vision and she placed the candle still lighted on the dresser

did i call did i have the nightmare why are you not in bed

i got up to see if you were all right answered dorothy truthfully do
you want anything shall i get you a nice cool drink from the ice tank

tavia was rubbing her face

whats this on my cheeks she asked bringing down her hand smeared
with cold cream

i thought you were feverish said dorothy and i put a little cream on
your face cold cream might be better than nothing i thought as we had
no alcohol

tavia did not seem her natural self and dorothy not slow to note the
change in her was only waiting to see her companion more fully awake
and so out of danger of being shocked suddenly before calling for help
or at least for some medicine

my head aches awfully said the girl on the bed i would like a drink
of water if if it is not too much trouble

a call bell was just at the door and dorothy touched the gong as she went
out into the hall to get the water

she had scarcely returned with the drink when miss higley in gown and
slippers entered the room the light had been turned on by this time
and tavia could see that the teacher was present but whether too sick
or too sleepy to notice she seemed to take the situation as a matter of
course and simply drank the water that dorothy held to her lips then
sank wearily back on her pillow

miss higley without saying a word picked up the hand that lay on the
coverlet and felt the pulse dorothy stood looking anxiously on

tavia really seemed sick and the tinge of scarlet crayon that remained
after dorothys cold cream wash added a higher tint to the feverish
flush that now suffused the girls cheeks

yes she has a fever whispered miss higley but it is not a very high
one i will go and get my thermometer meanwhile pick up your garments
dorothy so you can take my room while i stay here the rest of the
night

before dorothy could answer miss higley had tiptoed noiselessly from the
apartment dorothy did not like to leave tavia surely it was not anything
that might be contagious but when the teacher returned she insisted on
dorothy going directly to the room at the end of the hall while she took
up her post at the bedside of tavia

it seemed so hard to dorothy to leave her friend there alone with a
comparative stranger as she reluctantly closed the door on tavia and
miss higley dorothys eyes were filled with tears what could be the
matter all the joking had turned into reality in that short time

but tavia was surely not suffering any pain thought dorothy as she
seemed so sleepy and did not even murmur when miss higley gave her the
fever medicine it flashed across dorothys mind that it might have been
better to have acquainted miss higley with the way tavias attack came
on to tell her of the scene before the mirror but somehow dorothy felt
that she should not be told that it would be easier for tavia if her
strange actions were not mentioned to any one even to tavia herself
dorothy felt the matter would not be a pleasant one to discuss

and as no one knew it but dorothy she would keep it to herself unless
some development in tavias illness would make it necessary to give the
entire history of the case

with a head almost bursting it seemed from the stress of the
complication of worry and anxiety dorothy finally settled down on miss
higleys cretonne couch while the teacher tried to make herself
comfortable in dorothys place and tavia travers lay still and heavy
with a fever all unconscious of the changes that were going on about
her




                               chapter v
                           an untimely letter


for three days after that eventful night tavia was obliged to keep to her
room she had a fever from a cold the doctor thought nothing contagious
he was positive but as a precautionary measure dorothy was given another
room until the fever should be entirely broken

but the two friends were not to be separated much longer for tavia had
quite recovered now and was up and about her room receiving notes and
flowers from the girls and recuperating generally

the first good rest ive had in months tavia told dorothy as they sat
together again on the little window seat looking out on the tennis
court

i do really believe you look better than you did before you were taken
ill agreed dorothy giving her friend a look of unmistakable
admiration

thats lucky for me tavia replied with something that sounded like a
sigh

why asked dorothy in some surprise

oh nothing was the answer given rather evasively but a girl cant
afford to get scrawny fancy yourself slinking down like a cornstalk in
the fall why even the unapproachable dorothy dale could not well stand
the slinking process to say nothing of an ordinary gawk like me going
through it and tavia slyly looked into the mirror she evidently had
some particular reason for being so anxious about her good looks

dorothy had been noticing this peculiarity of tavias for some time she
had been so extreme about her toilet articles using cold cream to massage
her face daily then brushing her hair ardently every night to say
nothing of the steam baths she had been giving her face twice a week

all this seemed very strange to dorothy but when she laughed at tavias
newfound pastimes the latter declared she was going to look nice for the
summer and that any girl who did not take care of herself externally was
quite as blamable as she who neglected the hidden beauty of heart or
brain

and there was no denying that the grooming added much to the charms of
tavias personality her hair was now wonderfully glossy her cheeks
delicately pink her arms round and her hands so shapely all this
applied to a girl who formerly protested against giving so much as half
an hour daily to her manicure needs

dorothy was anxious to have a serious talk with tavia but considered it
too soon after her illness to bring about that conversation so she only
smiled now as tavia set all her creams and stuffs in a row then
stretched herself out perfectly flat to relax as the book directions
called for fancy tavia doing a thing like that

when i dare that is as soon as that old rip van winkle of a doctor lets
me off said tavia suddenly im going to get a set of exercisers for
myself i dont believe we have half enough muscle work

why my dear one would imagine you were training for the circus ring
said dorothy laughing

hardly replied the other i never was keen on bouncing and circus
turns all end with a bounce in the net those nets make me creepy a
mattress for mine when on the rebound have you been to the postoffice

no but im going want any stamps

no but if if you get a letter for me i wish you wouldnt put it into
mrs pangborns box i expect a little note from a girl and im sure it
need not be censored as the rest of the letters are

but the rule dorothy reminded her gently

i believe the united states postal laws are of more importance than the
silly baby rules of glenwood school snapped tavia with unexpected
hauteur and its against the law for one person to open the letters of
another

but mrs pangborn takes the place of our mothers she is really our
guardian when we enter her school we agree to the rules before we are
taken in

no we were taken in when we agreed to the rules persisted the
other now as its your turn to do the post office this week i think
you might do me a little favor i assure you the letter i expect is not
from some boy other girls can smuggle boys letters in and yet i cant
contrive to get a perfectly personal note from a perfectly sensible girl
without the missive being passed upon by googleeyed higley

oh tavia and she was so kind to you when you were sick

was she then she ought to keep it up and leave my letters alone

well sighed dorothy rising i must go for the mail at any rate

and you wont save my one little letter

how could i dorothy pleaded

then if you do get it see it among the others couldnt you leave it
there i will be able to walk down to the post office myself tomorrow

but you couldnt get the mail

oh yes i could and tavia tossed her head about defiantly

dorothy was certainly in a dilemma but she was almost due at the
postoffice and could not stay longer to argue so clapping on her hat
she bade tavia goodbye for a short time

it palls on me tavia told herself as she again approached the glass
and took up the cold cream jar who would ever believe that i would
stoop so low to deceive my own darling dorothy and to make a fool of
myself with this mugging as nat would say

she dropped heavily into a chair the thought of dorothy and nat had a
strange power over the girl she seemed ashamed to look at her own face
when the memory of her dearest friends brought her back again to the old
time tavia the girl free from vanity and true as steel to dorothy dale

but the letter thought tavia recovering herself if that letter gets
into mrs pangborns hands

again she buried her face in her arms something seemed to sway her
first one way then the other what had caused her to change so in those
last few short months why were her words so hollow now her own
copyrighted slang no longer considered funny even by those girls most
devoted to her originality and why above all else had she fallen ill
after that queer dream about makingup with the cold cream and the red
crayon

im afraid my mind was not built for secrets she concluded and if i
keep on moping this way i cant say what will happen next

meanwhile dorothy was making her way back from the village with the
letters including one addressed to octavia travers she had determined
not to make any attempt at giving the note to tavia without the school
principals knowledge for somehow she feared tavias honesty in such
matters and although dorothy felt certain that tavia would do nothing
she really believed to be wrong she was afraid her chum might be misled
by some outside influence

with a heavy heart dorothy laid the mail down on mrs pangborns desk
that lady was just coming into the office as dorothy was about to leave

wait dear said mrs pangborn until i see if there is any mail for
the girls in your corridor how is octavia today i hope she will be
able to go out by sunday here i guess this is a letter for her
dorothy almost turned pale as the principal took up the small blue
envelope just take it to her perhaps it will cheer her up and she
handed dorothy the missive without attempting to open it or question the
postmark there i guess that is all i can give you and she put the
others in her desk tell tavia i am anxious to see her out of doors
again and i hope her letter will have good news for her

dorothy turned away with a smile of thanks not venturing to say a word
she held the blue envelope in her hand as if it was some tainted thing
for she well knew that the missive was not from home the postmark
rochester standing out plainly on the stamped corner

tavia saw her coming and quickly caught sight of the envelope in her
hand

there you old darling she exclaimed giving dorothy a vigorous hug
i knew you would bring it to me how you did ever manage it

mrs pangborn sent it with kind wishes that it might contain good news
stammered dorothy i made no attempt to get it to you without her
knowledge

she had it and gave it back to you why dorothy if she had but of
course it would not really have mattered and tavia slipped the letter
into her blouse im awfully obliged did you hear from home

no answered dorothy simply a flush covering her fair face as she saw
tavia hide the letter im going out for a few minutes so you may read
that very important note tavia




                               chapter vi
                              on the lawn


when i was a very small girl exclaimed mollie richards otherwise
known as dick i used to hope i would die young so i could escape the
toothfilling process but here i am doing these dreadful exams and i
havent died yet

never despair quoted rosemary the worst is yet to come

cheer up fellows lisped little nita brandt weve been promised a
clambake when its all over

yes i fancy it will be all over with me when that clambake arrives
sighed edna black since tavia has turned turtle i dont even have the
fun of sneezing for exercise

its an ill wind and so on ventured dick that was a most abominable
habit of yours sneezing when you were too lazy to open your mouth to
laugh

but i never would have believed that tavia would get so so 

batty finished amy brooks its slang but i know of no english word
into which the explicit batty may be translated

and tavia of all girls added ned ponderingly

but it seems to agree with her declared cologne havent you noticed
her petal complexion

too much like the drug store variety objected nita i like something
more substantial

sour grapes fired back ned who could always be depended on to take
tavias part yours is so perfect 

oh i know freckles admitted the confused nita with a pout fair
skins always freckle

then why dont you close the fair and raffle off suggested dick
much easier than sleeping in lemon juice every night

molly richards youre too smart snapped the abused one

not altogether so replied dick at least this abominable french cant
prove it i have always believed that the only way to acquire a good
french accent would be to get acute tonsilitis then one might choke out
the gutterals beautifully

the girls of glenwood school were supposed to be busy preparing for
examinations they had congregated in little knots out of doors
scattering under the leafing oaks and the temptation to gossip was
evidently more than mere girls could withstand amid such surroundings

theres dorothy now announced cologne as the latter turned into the
path

yes and theres tavia followed ned showing keen pleasure as the late
absent one made her appearance on the lawn

now we will have a chance to study her complex  lisped nita with rather
a malicious tone

suit you better to study your complex verbs snapped ned while tavia
and dorothy came up at that moment

profuse greetings were showered upon tavia for the girls were well
pleased to have her back with them and it must be admitted that every
eye which turned toward her came back in an unanimous vote beautiful
even nita did not dare cast a dissenting glance she could not for indeed
tavia had improved wonderfully as we have seen under the grooming

her hazel eyes shown brighter than ever in her clear peachblow skin her
hair was not now too near red as nita had been in the habit of
declaring but a true chestnut brown and as glossy as her new tan
shoes whispered ned to cologne

tavia wore her brown gingham dress and much to the surprise of her
companions had her neck turned in

what happened to your collar asked dick with a merry twinkle in her
eyes

i happened to it answered tavia promptly no sense in having ones
neck all marked up from collars going about advertising capital
punishment

behold the new woman we will make her president of our peace
conference but of course we would not expect her to settle her own
squabs with nita we will have a committee of subs for that department
of the work said cologne as she made room for dorothy at her side
being anxious to get a private word with her tavia found a place between
ned and dick and soon the others were at least pretending to be at their
books realizing that too much time had already been wasted on outside
matters

the morning typified one of those rare days in june and the girls on the
lawn were like human spring blossoms indeed what is more beautiful than a
wholesome happy young girl

she need not be especially beautiful in feature for health and happiness
make her irresistible to the real student of beauty and the wonderful
charm of human life seems nowhere to be so perfectly depicted as in the
personality of a young girl

at last announced lena berg rolling over as the bell for recreation
sounded ending the period of openair study usually allowed at this
season

instantly the others were on their feet and as quickly had paired off
for their favorite pastime ned and tavia were together dorothy was with
cologne and the others had selected their companions to suit their
particular fancy

say parson began cologne using the name made for dorothy from her
initials d d and placing her arm about dorothys waist weve got a
great scheme on were going swimming

swimming dorothy almost screamed

exactly that insisted cologne mrs pangborn has given the permission
and we are to go to squinty lake tomorrow afternoon

squinty lake echoed dorothy in surprise

well they call it sunset you know but ned declares it is squinty as
no one can look out of the front of her eyes on the shores of it but
isnt it too giddy to go swimming so early and to think that higley is
the best swimmer of the respected faculty now if our dear little camille
crane were here feathers you know but i dont suppose she will be back
to the bench this season wasnt it too bad she should break down
rattled on cologne but for the swimming arent you perfectly
delighted you havent said a single word

why i havent had a chance replied dorothy laughing of course it is
lovely to think you can go

i can go arent you going

i dont believe so tavia is so fond of swimming and i am sure she
would not dare go in the water so soon after her fever so i guess ill
stay home to keep her company

oh you silly exclaimed cologne why should you stay out on her
account and possibly there was a note of jealousy in the girls tone
and a hint of it in her manner im very sure she wouldnt do as much
for you

indeed she would cologne dorothy hurried to say you have no idea
how kind tavia can be and has been to me why when i was sick home in
dalton she stayed with me night and day

well i cant see why you shouldnt go in bathing when you get a chance
precious seldom the chance comes at glenwood

i suppose mrs pangborn has hired the beach ventured dorothy

yes worse luck afraid any one would see our orphan asylum bathing
suits

indeed i think those brown suits very pretty objected dorothy i
thought so when i saw them taken out this spring of course i have never
worn one

of course you havent agreed cologne thats why you like em but
you should try to swim dog fashion in one of those knickerbockers the
skirts are built for hoops but they seemed to run short of goods on the
bloomers

but it is awfully good of mrs pangborn to provide for bathing when we
will soon be at our own summer quarters for it

yes i admitted that much at the start if you will remember but
really doro you had better make up your mind to go in its all
nonsense to stay out to keep tavia company im sure she would rather see
you in the swim

ill see answered dorothy as they turned back into the path that led
to the hall




                              chapter vii
                             at sunset lake


the day following proved to be one of those exceptionally warm days that
occasionally come at the end of june with the express purpose it would
seem of making life unbearable for those engaged in finishing up a term
at school all the morning the glenwood pupils lived on the thoughts of
the promised swim to come that afternoon when dismissal hour did
finally drag around little attention was paid to luncheon all minds and
hearts being set on the jaunt to sunset lake this was a summer resort
not far from the school and there was a good sandy stretch for bathing
the season had hardly opened yet and mrs pangborn was thus able to hire
for that afternoon the exclusive right of the sandy shore for her pupils

dorothy and tavia were to go although neither expected to take the lake
bath for dorothy was firm in her resolve to stay with tavia and so
forego one of her favorite pastimes for dorothy dale was counted an
excellent swimmer

in high glee the party started off under the chaperonage of miss higley
and even those pupils who insisted that she was a bear were forced to
admit that on this occasion she was as meek as a lamb the fact was
that miss higley loved swimming and knew she was expert at the exercise
so the promised sport was especially welcome to her

along the shady road to the lake dorothy laughed and chatted as merrily
as did the others but tavia was inclined to pout she had begged to be
allowed to go into the water declaring that she was entirely recovered
and that the swim would do her good but mrs pangborn would not consent
so tavia was to take what enjoyment she could derive from watching the
others

when the glenwood girls reached sunset beach the entrance gate to the
bathing grounds was locked against all outsiders a row of bathing houses
was placed at the disposal of the young ladies and there was a matron in
attendance in fact the pleasure grounds were turned over entirely to
mrs pangborns pupils and the presence of the whiteaproned attendant
gave the place a look of the utmost propriety on this occasion
likewise the life guard was banished and as dick expressed it there
never was a man in sight when the girls in brown took their annual

while the others were making themselves froglike in the aforementioned
suits dorothy and tavia established themselves in an old boat on the
shore of the lake

it was their first visit to the resort as it was their first summer term
at glenwood and the two girls were charmed with the pretty picturesque
surroundings

not much like our pond in dalton tavia observed viewing the placid
lake with its great open expanse of sunlit waters

no but that was a splendid little pond for swimming dorothy reminded
her companion never relishing any aspersions thrown in the direction of
dear old dalton

soon some of the girls appeared on the little boardwalk bordering the
lake and in unheard of politeness waited for miss higley to come out
and take the first plunge that formality being over there was a wild
rush for the water each one of the girls expecting to have a better time
than any of the others

nita brandt and adele thomas had not yet learned to swim so these two
were provided with a pair of waterwings to support them and they
floundered around like a couple of ferry boats tavia declared as they
made all sorts of vain attempts to strike out like the others

dick and cologne were soon engaged in a race from one float to the
other doing the overhand stroke and making a fine showing for the first
of the season efforts

youre exceeding the speed limit shouted tavia from the boat as she
stood up in the stern and viewed the race with unconcealed interest

get out of the way called a dozen voices as the twain with their
waterwings anchored directly in dicks course

but the girls floating on the wings could not get upon their feet for
they were in water about up to their heads every effort they made to
touch bottom seemed to send their faces down while simultaneously two
pair of stockings would shoot up above the surface of the lake

miss higley instantly realized that nita and adele were out too far that
they were beyond their depth and therefore in danger should the wings
which were muslin bags blown up burst or slip from under their arms
she did not wait to see the result of the race but struck out for the
now thoroughly frightened girls who were calling in vain for some one to
help them to shore

as miss higley reached them dick and cologne who had not grasped the
situation came gliding up to the same spot almost side by side working
earnestly each to outdistance the other in reaching the float which was
the goal

here shouted miss higley to them stop never mind the race help get
these two girls in theyre exhausted

the two swimmers veered around to nita and adele yes nita was gasping
she had evidently swallowed considerable water and adele could not
attempt another stroke her limbs seemed paralyzed

without speaking thinking to save her breath for the struggle cologne
took a position between the badly frightened girls while miss higley and
dick swung around so that each could grasp an arm one of nita and the
other of adele in this manner the three swimmers towed to shore those
who had ventured too far on the waterwings

for a few minutes there was plenty of excitement at sunset beach
everyone gathering around the rescued ones suggesting both restoratives
and punishments to close the incident

miss higley quietly waited for the girls to recover their breaths and
other faculties that had been temporarily suspended during the mishap
and then asked why they had ventured out so far

we didnt gulped nita we just stayed perfectly still and we kept
going along

well finished miss higley you must not again get on those wings
without some one at hand to help you or until you can manage them
better im thankful nothing worse happened

so nita and adele much chagrined and more disappointed were obliged to
spend the remainder of their swimming time with dorothy and tavia on the
beach as wading did not suit them after their attempt at swimming
unsuccessful as it had proven

as the afternoon waned the interest in the water exercise grew keener
and those who could trust themselves were indulging in all sorts of
stunts sliding down an inclined wooden chute and diving from a spring
board miss higley posted herself near the danger line realizing that
she must act as guard and look out for the safety of the swimmers

presently some one suggested an endurance trial and this attracted
almost all the girls away from the chute over toward the stretch of deep
water

but edna black did not join the racers she had never before tried
shooting the chutes and was infatuated with the sport time after time
she climbed the little ladder and as quickly slid down the curved
inclined plank into the water again dorothy and tavia were watching her
from the shore calling to her in merry nonsense and joking about her
sliding propensities

going down called tavia as edna took one more slide

they waited but she did not come up

miss higley too was watching for the young divers reappearance

ten twenty she counted but edna did not come up then from the very top
of the slide where she had taken her position some time before to better
watch all the girls miss higley dove into the water after edna cleaving
the fifteen feet of distance from the surface like a flash

dorothy and tavia stood breathless watching for either miss higley or
edna to come to the top

it seemed ages yes it was too long to stay under water what had
happened to miss higley where was edna

an instant later dorothy and tavia without exchanging a word kicked off
their slippers and were in the water there was no time to call to the
girls farther out not a swimmer was near enough to offer help

their light summer clothing seemed to make little difference to these two
country girls who had learned to swim in dalton pond and in a few
seconds both had reached the spot where edna and the teacher had
disappeared

tavia was the first to dive and in a few seconds she came up with edna
white and unconscious in her arms

hold her while i try for miss higley cried dorothy as tavia
supporting her burden on one arm and grasped the cross bar of the chute
with her other and yelled for help

dorothy was now under water groping for the other lost one but she had
to come up for air without bringing miss higley

down she went again taking a long breath and determining to remain under
until she could get a grip on the clothing of the teacher now the others
were close at hand to assist tavia in caring for edna down and down
dorothy went the water gurgling in her ears down and down into the
depths

it seemed as if she could not stand the strain and pressure a trail of
bubbles and a swirl of the surface of the lake marked where she had
disappeared

rosemary and dick were the first to reach tavia and they at once took
charge of the unconscious one floating her to shore between them then
others came up to the chute white frightened and trembling at the news
tavia gasped out to them so alarmed were they that none of them dared
venture to help dorothy down there in the blackness and silence at her
grewsome task

tavia as soon as she had recovered her breath had started off to assist
dick and rosemary in bringing edna to shore as the task was no light
one for the three swimmers then as she got into shallow water tavia
turned suddenly remembering something and shouted to the girls about
the chute

go for dorothy she is under there looking for miss higley

but as one or two of the braver girls feeling the need of action
prepared to dive they saw the pale face of dorothy dale come to the
surface and they saw that in her arms she held clasped the form of
miss higley but the hand that dorothy stretched out to grasp the bottom
of the chute that she might support herself and the inert burden just
failed to catch hold of the wooden brace and amid a swirl of waters
dorothy went down again out of sight with the unconscious teacher




                              chapter viii
                           a lively afternoon


there followed an eternity of suspense for those watching for the
reappearance of dorothy the missing of the hold she expected to get on
the board and the effort to keep miss higley up together with the
struggle she had gone through caused the girl to lose all control of
herself she had sunk instantly without having any opportunity of using
her free arm to keep herself above water

seeing this rosemary and molly who had climbed out on the base of the
chute jumped into the lake again making for the spot where they saw
dorothy go down the second time

but before they could reach it they saw dorothys head above the surface
she had come up under the chute in an open square of water formed by
the four supporting posts of the affair cautiously she reached out and
caught hold of a beam then another arm was seen to grasp a projecting
plank miss higley was struggling

she was not dead not unconscious

dorothy screamed tavia from shore as she saw the form of her chum
come to the surface the second time but tavia did not see dorothy wave a
reassuring hand at her as she climbed up on the chute and helped miss
higley support herself across one of the base planks for tavia had
fallen unconscious beside edna who was only just beginning to show signs
of life under the prompt administrations of rosemary and dick

in all this confusion the whiteaproned matron forgot to use her
telephone but as she now assisted the other girls in working over edna
she directed some of the swimmers who had come to shore to look after
tavia

lena berg the quietest girl of glenwood rushed into the bathing office
and telephoned to central to send doctors almost before those working
over edna and tavia had realized it and almost as soon as the throng of
young ladies had started to assist miss higley and dorothy to shore an
automobile with two doctors in it stopped at the gate the physicians
were soon working over tavia and edna

a few seconds later rosemary and molly pulled up to shore in an old boat
they had found anchored near the chute and in the craft which they
rowed with a broken canoe paddle were dorothy and miss higley

as so often happens that one small accident is responsible for any number
of mishaps especially where girls or women become panicstricken it
seemed now that the rescue of miss higley and dorothy acted like magic to
restore all four victims of the water to their senses at least if not
to actual vigor tavia and edna both jumped up as the boat grounded on
the beach and miss higley and dorothy staggered ashore

be careful cautioned one of the physicians as the teacher was seen to
totter and almost fall she was plainly very weak and while the
younger doctor looked after dorothy the other who was his father took
miss higley into the bathing pavilion office to administer to her there

tavia had only fainted indeed she had been scarcely able to swim out to
help edna not being entirely recovered from her recent nervous fever
edna had swallowed considerable water but it was fresh and when she had
been relieved of it and the usual restoratives applied she too was
herself again

dorothy insisted there was absolutely nothing the matter with her but it
was plain that such physical efforts as she had been obliged to make in
her rescue of miss higley must at least exhaust a girl of her frail
physique so young dr morton insisted on her being assisted in a
thorough rub then she was given a warm stimulating drink and soon
after that dorothy was able to tell what had happened

an hour later all the brown bathing suits had been discarded tavia and
dorothy had been supplied with dry clothing and all the glenwood girls
who had come to sunset lake sat on the rocky shore back of the sand
waiting for the hour to arrive when they must start back to the school
there was no lack of talk to make the time pass quickly

miss higley seemed the least perturbed of any she had a way of always
being beyond a mere personal feeling she never allowed herself to
encourage pains or aches in fact she was one of those strongminded
women who believe that all the troubles of this life are hatched in the
human brain and therefore the proper cure for all ills is the
eradication of the germ producer sickthoughts so as soon as she felt
her lungs in working order again she took the defensive as tavia
expressed it and sat up as straight as a whip with her glasses at
exactly the proper pitch and the black cord at precisely the accustomed
dangle

marvelous gasped dick aside giving the long word an inimitable
roll and at the same time bestowing a wondering look on the recently
resuscitated teacher

but do tell us begged rosemary what happened first of all those
exciting things

i did answered edna black i was shooting the chute to my hearts
content when all of a sudden i stuck somewhere then after trying
everything i knew how to do to get loose i said my prayers

next called rosemary indicating tavia

well of course began tavia dorothy and i were not to go near the
water but when we saw edna turn up missing we just kicked off our
slippers and in the language of the poets got busy i found ned here
first shot stuck in between the two corner boards of the chute posts
she didnt need any coaxing to come up once i untangled her skirt from a
nail which held it fast and i brought her up without any unnecessary
explanations

and in the meantime miss higley had gone down interjected dorothy
that is she went down after edna first

and came up last added the teacher with a significant nod to dorothy

how did you find miss higley parson rosemary continued to question
with a view to getting the entire story

i found her in a mud hole held fast but able to help herself somewhat
then i i got her up somehow 

indeed i was almost unconscious until you dragged my head up to the
air miss higley hastened to say anxious to give dorothy her due for
certainly the rescue was a matter of heroic effort and miss higley
being heavy and at the same time unable to help herself gave dorothy
the most difficult of all the surprising tasks of that eventful
afternoon

but when she sank that time like a stone suggested dick to dorothy

oh i merely missed catching hold of a plank and i had to go down i
couldnt keep up

certainly why not put in nita brandt glad to be able to say
something safe

and you lispy said lena to nita you and adele started the epidemic
with your water wings next time make it life preservers

the girlish spirits bottled up during the period of worry came out
with a resounding pop now and the walk home proved even pleasanter
than the one to the beach

for now declared ned between her jokes we are like the man who
laughed at the ugly cow from inside the fence he found it much funnier to
laugh at the cow from outside the fence




                               chapter ix
                           dorothy and tavia


for more than a week after the happenings at sunset lake the pupils of
glenwood school had little time for anything outside of the regular
program of the institution it was a matter of sleep eat exercise then
study and recite and then the same schedule was begun all over again the
following day but this was the end of the term and so much remained to
be done that it was necessary to keep going as the girls expressed it
so that the last day would find the records of the years work up to
the usual high standard

this mental housecleaning is perfectly terriblocious declared tavia
one morning showing her aptitude at coining alleged new words this one
being a contraction of terrible and ferocious

but how nice it will be when we are all done dorothy reminded her
taking up her books and papers to attend the last exercise in
mathematics

perhaps sighed tavia

the conversation was ended abruptly by the sound of the bell summoning
the girls to class and they went back to the housecleaning each
doing her best to finish honorably in spite of the difference of their
respective motives

that evening dorothy and tavia went to their room early tavia seemed
tired and dorothy did not wish to disturb her by coming in later

neither appeared inclined to talk and as tavia went through her
elaborate toilet preparations the facial massage and all the
accompaniments dorothy watched her in silence

strange as it was to believe tavia so vain dorothy had become accustomed
to this nightly process and now accepted it without comment neither had
she ever told tavia of that night when in her sleep she had gone
through the makingup process

but school would soon be over and then 

for some time dorothy had been putting off a talk she desired to have
with tavia a talk about their vacation plans somehow she dreaded to
undertake the topic that tavia had been so obviously avoiding but
tonight dorothy felt that she must have an understanding she must know
where her roommate intended to spend her vacation

dorothy was just about to broach the subject when tavia suddenly turned
to her with this surprising question

dorothy do you think im pretty

why of course you are stammered dorothy you know i have always
thought you pretty

but i do not mean what you always thought doro i am awfully serious
now am i really pretty

i dont know replied her chum i could not tell what others might
think but i have always thought you the prettiest kind of a girl you know
that

but do you think that in in a crowd i might be considered attractive
are my features good do i look look interesting

this was said with such apparent simplicity that dorothy almost laughed
there stood a pretty girl without question a remarkably pretty girl of a
most unusual type and she was begging for a compliment no for an opinion
of her personality

dorothy did not answer she could not possibly say that at that moment
tavia was a perfect vision as she stood in her white robe with her
freshlybrushed hair framing the outline of her sweet young face but
the girl before the mirror wanted to know

dorothy do tell me she begged what do you think am i pretty or
not

tavia exclaimed dorothy suddenly tell me why do you want to
know

why and tavia laughed a little to gain time i think any girl ought
to know just what she is like

but all this this fussing why do you do it

to experiment and tavia laughed lightly they say one can do wonders
with a little care i am tired of reading that in the magazines so i
thought i would just try it she had finished with the glycerine and
rose water now so the stuffs were put away and tavia sank down with a
gladofit sigh

of course began dorothy breaking into the topic of summer vacation
you will go home first before you come to north birchland you will
want to see everybody in dalton i wish i could go along with you but i
have no home in dalton now

come with me suggested tavia we have plenty of room

oh i was only romancing of course i should like to see everybody in
dear old dalton but i have to go to daddy and the boys isnt it
splendid to have a vacation it makes school worth while

yes replied tavia vaguely preparing to turn out the light

when do you think you will come to north birchland asked dorothy
directly

i cant tell i expect to visit grace barnum in buffalo her folks are
old friends of mothers i had a letter from her yesterday especially
inviting me

oh did you and dorothy looked surprised i did not hear you speak of
going to buffalo i thought you intended to come to birchland as soon as
you had seen your folks you know aunt winnie expects you and so do the
boys

oh ill get to the birches some time during the summer i guess tavia
hurried to say as she noted dorothys disappointment you can depend
upon it i expect to have some of the fine times you are not to have a
monopoly of the good things

then you are going to dalton first then to buffalo and what time do
you count on getting to birchland persisted dorothy determined to
know if possible just what tavias plans really were

oh my dear and tavia indulged in a discordant yawn do lets go to
sleep im almost dead

but tavia you always make some excuse when i ask you about vacation
and dorothys tone was in no way drowsy she certainly was not sleepy

and you always ask such unreasonable questions retorted tavia just
as if i can tell what may happen between now and midsummer

tavia exclaimed dorothy with a sob i feel just as if something
dreadful was going to happen i dont know why but you you have changed
so and the girl buried her head in her pillow and cried as if something
dreadful had really happened

doro dear and tavia clasped the weeping girl in her arms what can
be the matter what have i done you know i love you better than anyone
in the whole world and now you accuse me of changing

but you have changed insisted dorothy sobbing bitterly everybody is
talking about it and if you knew what a time i have had trying trying to
stand up for you

to stand up for me repeated tavia what have i done that need provoke
comment surely it is my own business if i do not choose to be the school
monkey any longer let some of the others turn in and serve on the
giggling committee i think i have done my share

oh it isnt that and dorothy jabbed her handkerchief into her eyes
but you are so so different you always seem to be thinking of something
else

something else and tavia tried to laugh surely it is no crime to
be thoughtful

well i think it is perfectly dreadful for a girl to go and grow
straight up without any warning

what an old lady i must be and tavia looked very severe and dignified
but doro dear you need not worry you surely believe i would never do
anything i really thought wrong

thats just it you would not think it wrong but suppose you did
something that turned out to be wrong

tavia made no answer but the old lady look came back into her face that
serious expression so new to her she seemed to be looking far ahead far
away at some uncertain remote possibility

for several minutes neither girl spoke they could hear the miscreants
who had been out after hours creeping past their door every one in
glenwood should be asleep the last hall light had just been turned
out but the girls from dalton were still thinking

dorothy usually the one to mend matters tonight seemed sullen and
resolute plainly tavia was hiding something from her and while dorothy
could bear with any amount of mistakes or impulsive little wrongdoings
she could not put up with a deliberate slight a premeditated act of
deception

tavia saw that she was bound to hold out to insist upon a clearing up
and as this did not suit her for reasons best known to herself she
attempted to pet dorothy back to her usual forgiving mood

but the storm that had been so long brewing was in no hurry to blow over
and dorothy went to bed with swollen eyes and an aching head while tavia
only pretended to sleep she had an important letter to write an answer to
the one that had come in on the evening mail and required to be replied
to by return of post this meant that the missive must be penned that
night and dropped in the postoffice the very first thing in the morning

dear little dorothy tavia murmured as she looked down on the fair
face to make sure that the eyes were resting in sleep i will never do
anything to disgrace you only have a little patience and you will
understand it all but i must must  and then she broke off with a long
long sigh




                               chapter x
                            leaving glenwood


but one more day remained of the school term at glenwood all the tests
had been concluded and as there were to be no formal exercises the
last day was given over entirely to packing up and making ready for
the departure from the institution

dorothy and tavia were busy with the others to dorothy the prospect of
seeing her dear ones so soon filled every thought of this days work
tavia too seemed more like her old self and jollied the girls as she
flung things into her trunk with her usual disregard for order

theyll all have to come out again she replied to dorothys
remonstrance so whats the use of being particular how they go in

but your pretty christmas bag begged dorothy do be careful not to
crush that

oh indeed theres nothing to crush i took the ribbons out of it for
the neck and sleeves of my white lawn and when i extracted them from the
flowered stuff there was nothing left but a perfectly flat piece of
cretonne with a row of little brass rings on one side i just ran a bit
of faded ribbon through the rings and just wait until i show you

at this tavia plunged her hands down into the depths of her trunk and
presently brought up the article in question

there she exclaimed clapping the bag on her head isnt that a
pretty sunbonnet

dorothy beheld it in amazement

it certainly does look sweet on you she said but what in the world
will you want a fancy sunbonnet for surely you will not use it in
dalton and in buffalo 

i think it would make a tremendous hit in buffalo declared tavia
wheeling around to show off the effect of her thick brown hair beneath
the little row of brass rings that held the ribbon which bound the bit of
flowered stuff to her neck at the front her face seemed to fit exactly
and surely nothing could be more becoming than that christmas bag

oh i think its a shame faltered dorothy to spoil that beautiful
bag to make a plaything

but we all have to have playthings said tavia with a strong accent
on the word play then with one more swing around like a figure in a
show case tavia took off the sunbonnet and went on with her packing

it seems so queer dorothy remarked sliding her tennis racquet down
the side of her trunk that we should be going in different directions
we have always been able to help each other in the packing before

well id just like to leave half my old truck behind replied tavia
and i dont know but what i will have to if this trunk wont stretch a
little its chock full now and just look at the commotion on the
floor

i told you insisted dorothy that you would have to put the things in
differently now you will have to take them all out again and roll them
up tight you can get twice as much in that way

take them all out tavia almost shrieked never and following this
exclamation the girl jumped into the trunk and proceeded to dance the
trunk travelers jig on the unfortunate collection of baggage

tavia dont begged dorothy im sure i heard something break

oh that was my last summers hat breaking up its plans for this year i
put it in the bottom in hopes that it would meet an untimely end but i
really did not intend to murder it she joked stepping out of the
trunk

but at any rate she went on as she flung part of the commotion off
the floor into the hollow she had succeeded in making for the various
articles the poor old thing will take up less room dead than alive and
there will be no possible danger of my having to wear it for a turn or
two when i get home nothing like getting in ones supplies while youre
fresh before the folks have a chance to get too friendly with you ive
found that out

but it was a real pretty hat

well even pretty hats are not immune from accidents and you saw
yourself that it was an accident pure and simple

a half hour later all the trunks had been packed and the two dalton
girls sat in their little room exchanging confidences and making all
sorts of schoolgirl promises of writing often and sending pretty cards
besides having photographs taken of which to make especially affectionate
remembrances

ill send you one just as soon as i get to buffalo tavia declared
holding dorothy very close for the latter seemed much inclined to cry as
the hour of parting drew near

but it will be so lonely in north birchland without you persisted
dorothy with a sob i do wish you would give up that trip to buffalo

tavia assured her chum that it would be impossible as she had promised
grace barnum to go to her home to visit her

dorothy finally jumped up and made an effort to pull herself together
she went over to the dresser and picked up a book

is this yours she began and then stopped suddenly it was a gust of
wind that had blown up the thin strip of muslin covering the top of the
dresser and revealed the little red book it had been concealed there
and as dorothy took it up she saw on the cover

                               how to act
                        the beginners guide

tavia was at the other end of the room and did not at once see the book
in dorothys hand

did you do you want this dorothy stammered again holding the volume
out toward tavia

a deep flush instantly came over tavias face dorothy was watching her
with a look a look at once pleading and full of sadness

tavia put out her hand for the book

oh that funny little leaflet she tried to say as if it were a joke
i suppose i might just as well take it but its full of the worst sort
of nonsense let me show you 

oh no dont bother replied dorothy rather stiffly but that seems
a queer sort of a book to take home from boarding school hadnt you
better destroy it as you say it is all nonsense

the red covers of the pamphlet fluttered in tavias hand the flush on
her cheeks threatened to match the hue of the book and told its own
guilty story

oh i might as well take it with me and tavias words sounded rather a
lame excuse it will be amusing to read on the train

oh tavia dorothy burst into tears wont you give up those stage
notions do please and she clasped her arms about her chum weeping
bitterly

oh dont dorothy dont cry so begged tavia stroking the yellow
head i will give it up all up yes dorothy dear listen look here
and at that dorothy raised her head

with her hands free tavia tore the little red book into shreds and tossed
them into the waste basket

there she exclaimed im through with through with all of it i dont
want to know how to act ill never try dorothy dorothy and the
miserable girl threw herself upon the bed in a frenzy of grief and
excitement just forgive me for it all for trying to deceive you i have
been wretched all through it and i only want you and all the others just
as you used to be i dont believe in ambition she stood upright ill
go home to dear old dalton and stay there until until i come to you at
north birchland

when the other girls tapped on the door of room nineteen late that
afternoon to say goodbye they found two very happy young maidens
waiting for the particular carriage that was to take them to the depot
dorothy and tavia could not be separated they clung to each other in
spite of all the invitations to do the rounds and join in the last and
noisiest fun of the season together very demurely they called at the
office to say goodbye to the teachers

when at last the carriage did come for them dorothy and tavia rode off
together one bound for the train to north birchland and the other going
home home to dalton to try to be happy in the little country town where
she and dorothy dale had spent such a happy childhood and where tavia
would find plenty of time to dream of things scattered far out in another
world that seemed like the golden fingers of ambition beckoning her on
to leave dalton and the common school life to enter the walks of city
uncertainties to become part of the great grinding machine of human
hardships that machine which is always willing to stop its terrific speed
long enough to gather into its cogs and meshes the life of an innocent
young girl




                               chapter xi
                          a jolly homecoming


my what great big boys you cant possibly be my little baby brother
roger and joe why he is like a real young gentleman in his tennis
suit and dorothy kissed her brothers over and over again as they rode
from the depot in the pony cart to the home of aunt winnie the cedars
at north birchland

oh i dont know drawled joe in his goodnatured way you cant
complain youve been doing some growing on your own account

and you have got awfully pretty lisped roger as he snuggled up
closer to his sister

i think you are just as perfectly handsome as any big lady

my you little flatterbox and dorothy gave him an oldtime squeeze
you have learned more than your a b cs at kindergarten i received
all your letters but could not answer the last two as we had such an
awful lot of writing to do at the close when examinations came

did you pass asked the younger brother by way of showing his
understanding of the scholastic season

oh yes i guess tavia and i did about as well as the others

why didnt tavia come went on roger

she is coming later you know she had to go home to dalton first oh
how lovely the cedars look and there is daddy on the porch

dorothy could scarcely remain in the cart as it rumbled along the shady
drive that led to the broad veranda of mrs whites handsome summer
residence major dale was waiting to greet his daughter and aunt winnie
came down the steps as the cart drove up

isnt she big exclaimed roger as the major folded dorothy close in
his arms in a most affectionate manner

my dear whispered mrs white pressing upon dorothys cheek a kiss of
welcome you have grown and the glance that accompanied this simple
remark spoke in more than words mrs whites admiration for her pretty
niece and told dorothy at once that her aunt winnie was entirely
satisfied with the particular lines that her growth had taken on

you all look so well and i am so glad to be home again at last said
dorothy as soon as she had a chance to express her opinion it is
perfectly fine here

here come the boys called joe who was just turning around on the long
drive preparatory to taking the cart to the stables and presently nat
and ned came bouncing up the steps

before dorothy had a chance to protest both cousins were kissing her at
once nat declaring he hadnt kissed a girl since he left dorothy after
the automobile ride at glenwood and the while ned was insisting that his
little brother should await his turn and allow the head of the house
the rights of his lawful inheritance

such jolly big boys as were ned and nat always have a way of making
things both lively and interesting especially when a pretty girl cousin
is up for entertaining and for the remainder of the afternoon they
entirely monopolized dorothy while joe and roger looked on satisfied to
hear their sisters voice again as for the major he sat there perfectly
content to see all his children about him once more although it was a
trifle odd to find dorothy so grown up almost a young lady and it was so
short a time ago that she would climb all over him when a little
homecoming occurred how she would fuss with his hair and complain that
no one had attended to his brushes or kept his neckties pressed during
her absence

but children must grow up said the major with a sigh and dorothy is
a fine girl a dale every inch of her

that dorothy was indeed growing to be very handsome was a matter that
mrs white contemplated with pardonable pride dorothy was now her
especial charge she would enter society under her safe chaperonage of
course she would first finish her education and the aunt hoped that her
niece would not decide to take the higher branches inasmuch as this
would keep her longer separated from her relatives there is plenty of
time mrs white decided to learn in our own little world without spending
precious time buried in colleges forming ideas that are sure to conflict
with the regular home life and perhaps depriving ones family of the
most precious years of a girls career the time between morning and noon
in the life of mortals

that evening while dorothy was dressing for dinner her aunt mentioned
the matter to her

of course dorothy dear she said as she watched the girl arrange her
beautiful hair it is all very well to take a college course if you
think you would not be satisfied to live in the homeworld always but
your brothers are growing up and a sisters influence is of so much
account to growing lads i hope you will be satisfied to stay home with
us after you have finished at glenwood

im sure im very lonely away from you all answered dorothy and as
you say it is not likely i will ever want to take up a profession
therefore i can best finish my education along the lines i will be
required to be most proficient in

thats my own dorothy said her aunt

it was a merry party that sat down to the bountifully supplied table
major dale was of course at the head and mrs white occupied the seat
of honor at the other end while dorothy and ned then nat and joe with
roger next his father made up the family party

roger insisted on knowing just what dorothy usually had for dinner at
glenwood and upon learning how extremely simple the school menu was he
decided at once he would never go to boarding school

whens tavia coming asked nat endeavoring to hide his particular
interest in that question by trying prematurely to swallow an unusually
large mouthful of food

she promised to come in a few weeks answered dorothy she expects to
visit buffalo first

buffalo repeated nat vaguely

any objections asked ned pointedly to tease his younger brother

well replied nat lamely buffalo is a big city and tavia
is is merely a little girl

this remark only made matters worse for nat as the others joined in the
jollying and he was obliged to admit that he did miss tavia and was
very sorry she had decided not to visit birchland first

i dont blame you little brother declared ned tavia certainly is a
winner and when it comes to an allround jolly
goodnatured er ah um help me out dorothy any new adjectives at
glenwood

try dandy suggested joe

oh great put in little roger to whom dandy always meant something
great

thanks thanks acknowledged ned i think if lady tavia stands for all
of that she surely will be well done

oh she can stand for more than that insisted her champion she once
confided to me that she stood for a colored baby it was christened in
the dalton canal i believe and no one in the crowd of spectators had
the nerve to stand for the little one but tavia

and did she give him his name asked roger all at once interested in
the black baby in the canal

she did for a fact nat replied yes tavia called that coon moses
and if you dont believe it she still has an active interest in the
modern human frog let me tell you she sent him a goat cart on his last
birthday

oh ho exclaimed ned significantly so that was the goat cart you
bought down at tims eh now i call that real romantic mother you
must include mosey when next you invite folks from dalton

oh yes aunty please do begged roger clapping his hands i just
love little colored boys they talk so funny and warble their eyes so

warble repeated nat why not scramble scrambled eyes would look
real pretty i think

well retorted roger i watched a coon boy look that way one day and
the yolk of his eye stuck away up behind the the cover yes it
did really for the others were laughing at him and i told him it was
a good thing that the looker didnt rub off

everyone agreed with roger that it was a very good thing that lookers
didnt rub off and so the small talk drifted from mose to more
substantial topics

directly after dinner dorothy went to the library to sing and play for
the major she had of course improved considerably in her music and
when the usual favorites were given including some war songs besides
two little boys in blue for rogers special benefit the boys kept her
busy the remainder of the evening playing college songs one after the
other for as fast as they discovered they did not know one they would
make a try at the next

now they miss tavia whispered mrs white in an aside to the major
she is a genius at funny songs what she doesnt know she has a faculty
for guessing at with splendid results

yes indeed its a pity she didnt come along with dorothy they have
always been inseparable and i rather miss the little imp myself
tonight admitted the major

but when the singers came to the old classics seeing nellie home ned
cut nellie out and substituted tavias name whereat nat insisted that
he could not stand any more of the obsequies and so broke up the
performance with a heartrending and earsplitting discordant yell

well youll feel better after that old boy remarked ned it must be
something awful to have a thing like that in your system

but nat was not altogether joking in fact he had more reason than was
apparent for wishing tavia was with the little party tavia had written
one or two letters to nat just friendly notes of course but the tone of
them caused the youth to think that tavia travers when with dorothy dale
was one girl and tavia travers with others the buffalo people for
example might be quite a different person

shes like an hour glass thought nat as he stood on the side porch
and tried to laugh at himself for being spoony then he went on shes
full of sand all right but too easily influenced now with dorothy 

but at that nat turned suddenly and went to join the others in the
library it was nonsense for him to worry about a girl probably she would
not thank him for his trouble could she know that he had the audacity to
question her conduct

but in spite of this thoughts of tavia persisted in thrusting
themselves upon him after all sincerity of purpose is a power that
once aroused is not easily cast aside it is without question one of
the greatest factors for good in all this big and complicated system of
endeavor in reality the tie that binds

so that nat had taken tavias affairs to heart as he admitted to
himself when thinking the entire matter over very late that night and
from that time on whether he willed or not it seemed to him that these
affairs of tavias had a queer way of following him up although he
little realized that this was the price he would be called upon to pay
for his sincerity of purpose the live factor that exists in spite of all
obstacles of indifference




                              chapter xii
                           dorothy is worried


dorothy had been at the cedars one short delightful week when again the
question of tavia and her plans came up for serious consideration mrs
white and her niece sat out on the veranda with the early summer flowers
perfuming the soft zephyrs that came through the vinecovered lattice
and they were talking of the absent one wondering why she did not come to
birchland and instead went to the city in the summer to buffalo when
everybody in the place except the tourists on the way to niagara to the
falls were leaving for more quiet and recreative surroundings

im afraid said mrs white finally that tavia is stagestruck

these words came to dorothy like a blow something long dreaded but
materialized at last in spite of hopes and promises

oh aunt winnie exclaimed dorothy with a sigh you dont really think
tavia would do anything wrong

no that i do not my dear promptly answered mrs white a thing is
not wrong unless we intend to make it so but tavia has a queer idea of
right and wrong you know she has had no home discipline no training in
character building she has grown to be as good as she is through the
commonest law of nature she was born good but she has not gone beyond
that same law in growing better than she started out to be that is moral
development and requires careful culture and prudent discipline

but the stage whispered dorothy as if afraid the very word would
breathe contamination do you think tavia would would ever try to to go
on a public stage

on that point i could not now express an opinion answered the aunt
kindly noticing how seriously dorothy had taken her words of course if
she happened to get in with persons interested in that line of work she
might be tempted to try it

but what could she do there are no plays now it is summer time

the very time my dear when small companies try to get a hearing there
are no good plays to attract persons and the stayathomes need some
amusement

this had not occurred to dorothy before her dread of tavia going on the
stage had been kept within bounds by the thought that there were no plays
given in any of the theatres for dorothy knew little about such things
and had never given a thought to those small companies the
barnstormers

well she announced with a sigh i believe i will have to write to
her i can not rest and not know just where she is somehow i feel as if
my own sister had deserted me as if she were out among strangers oh
aunt winnie you can not realize how much tavia has always been to me
and dorothy dropped her head in her hands to hide the expression of
sincere grief that marked her face

well child there is absolutely no need to worry no doubt tavia is
snugly home at this moment with her own little oldfashioned mother or
even out in buffalo enjoying the visit to her mothers friends to sit
down and imagine all sorts of horrible things why dorothy it is very
unlike you

perhaps i am silly dorothy agreed smiling brightly as she looked up
but you know tavia has been so odd lately and then she was sick you
know

dorothy looked off across the lawn but she seemed to see nothing
perhaps she had a dayvision of her friend far away but whatever dorothy
imagined was far from what tavia was actually engaged in at that moment

well come my dear said her aunt at length the boys are waiting
with the auto see what a spin through the country will do for tired
nerves i tell you this winding up of school is always trying more so
than you can imagine you are after all pretty well tired out in spite
of your pretty pink cheeks and she tilted dorothys chin up to reach
her own lips just as nat swung himself up on the porch and demanded the
immediate presence of his aunt and cousin in the fire bird that panted
at the door

but somehow the afternoon was all lost on dorothy those words
stagestruck echoed in her ears and she longed to get back to her room
and write to tavia and then to receive the answer that she might show it
to aunt winnie to prove that tavia was as reliable as ever that she
would soon be with them all at north birchland

when after a spin that on any other occasion would have been
delightful ned alighted at the little village postoffice dorothy asked
him to bring her out two special delivery stamps her cousin inquired
what the rush of mail was for but she only smiled and tried to hide the
fact that she really had occasion to provide for sending a letter in a
hurry and receiving its reply as fast as uncle sam could bring it

they started off again and a long exhilarating spin brought them out
upon the direct road to the cedars then after helping their mother and
dorothy out the boys shooed the fire bird back to its nest and made
a dash to witness the last inning of a ball game that had been in
progress all the afternoon on the grounds just across the broad meadow
that stretched in front of their home

this left dorothy to herself for the major had finally listened to
rogers earnest appeal to take him to the ball game joe went with the
boys who carried the bats as the latter was always sure to be on time
then as mrs white would be busy for some time giving orders for
dinner dorothy hurried to her room and sat down to think it all out
before she undertook to put into written words what she wanted to say to
tavia

as dorothy had said to her aunt the loss of tavias companionship was
like missing that of a dear sister for the two girls had been
inseparable since early childhood they had always been together or they
knew they would be apart but for a few days at most

but now it was different heretofore each time that dorothy thought she
would have to be obliged to leave tavia either to attend school or take
some new step in life it so happened that tavia went along so that the
chain of companionship that began at dalton had not yet been broken

and of course dorothys worries might all be unfounded as mrs white
had said tavia might be safe at home with her mother

so it was to dalton that dorothy addressed her letter she needed to be
particular in wording it so that no misunderstanding would arise should
the letter fall into other hands than tavias dorothy enclosed a special
delivery stamp for a hurried answer which she begged tavia to send and
she put another of the stamps on the envelope of her own missive

there she said with a sigh of relief as she slipped the little
creamcolored square into her blouse i shall just have time to run to
the office with it before dinner somehow i feel better already it
almost seems as if i had been talking to tavia i will surely have an
answer by tomorrow night i do wonder oh i wonder where tavia is and
what she is doing just now

it was a pleasant walk to the country postoffice and dorothy hurried
along in a happier frame of mind than she had enjoyed during all that
day the small worry that had been smouldering in her heart for some
weeks ever since the night of tavias queer actions in her sleep when
she painted her face with the red crayon did not need much encouragement
to burst forth into a live flame

and that was precisely what happened when nat also expressed the opinion
that tavia should have come to north birchland and that buffalo was a
big place for such a small girl then that dorothys aunt should state
plainly her fear regarding tavias love for the stage surely all this
was enough to throw dorothy into a very fever of anxiety

that dorothy knew of tavias strange actions on that one occasion and
that she alone was aware of this added to the anxiety the book how to
act had betrayed tavias secret in clearer terms than even dorothy would
admit to herself but if tavia should run away and if dorothy had not
warned the travers folks in time

that evening after mailing her letter dorothy made an excuse to leave
the rest of the family and so remained in her own room she wanted to be
alone to think in fact she had been so accustomed to those little
solitary thinking spells in glenwood that the time at the cedars seemed
to be a trifle too exacting the boys wanted to be with their sister and
mrs white had so much to talk over it was so delightful to have a big
daughter to converse with then the major needed dorothys counsel in
many small but important matters so that altogether the girl from
glenwood found herself busy just a little too busy considering the
problem she was trying to solve which was how to get immediately into
communication with tavia

that night she dreamed of it all and for three days following the
mailing of her letter she could scarcely think of anything other then why
the expected answer did not arrive

finally dorothy felt that she must take some one into her confidence
all the nervous energy of her young nature had for days been so set
upon that one point to hear from tavia that the whole circumstance had
assumed great importance she could think of nothing else every hour
added to her anxiety she imagined all sorts of dreadful things yes she
must tell somebody of it and thus relieve her mind or she felt she would
be ill this seemed to her the greatest trouble she had ever encountered

it was a delightful summer evening when dorothy dressed in her seafoam
mulle gown with its dainty silver white trimmings stepped out on the
porch and had the good fortune to find nat there alone it was to her
young cousin that she had made up her mind to confide her worries and
here he was as if he was just waiting to help her in this matter of her
own heart and tavias

great scott but you startled me exclaimed nat jumping up from the
hammock i do believe doro that i had clean forgotten that you were
with us no offense but you see i was sort of dreaming and when you glided
through that window well i say doro i thought my dream had come true

nat could you come for a little walk asked dorothy you should not
dream so early and besides you should not at any time dream of young
girls you admitted as much you know but nat i just want a quiet
talk come out along the road as far as the bridge i want to make sure we
are entirely alone

now you dont expect me to move the bridge do you doro we may be all
alone with the exception of the old stone walls and the planks

tucking dorothys arm under his own nat led the way down the path then
out upon the open road which was now streaked with faint beams of
moonlight that filtered down through the trees nat seemed to feel that
dorothy wanted to talk of tavia for he had not been slow to notice the
growing look of anxiety that had come upon his cousins face in the last
few days

heard from tavia he asked in a matteroffact way thinking to help
dorothy on with her story

no nat she answered and that is just what i want to talk about i
am almost worried to death about her whatever do you think it means

think what what means that tavia has not answered a letter why that
doesnt mean anything at least it didnt last winter when she would
write me for something she wanted me to get for her and forget to write
again saying she had received it i suppose all girls think they should
take their time writing to a fellow but tavia was about the limit so
you have no reason to fret as she will probably write to you the day she
packs her trunk to come to the cedars then she wont have time to mail
the letter so when she gets here and steams off the uncancelled stamp
she will calmly hand over the note now thats tavia and her way of being
prompt

but this is different said dorothy i did not know tavia wrote to you
last winter

now dont go to romancing i believe i did get two letters from miss
travers in answer to five i had written to her it was about that little
colored boy you heard me joking about some imp tavia had taken a fancy
to and she wanted to get him a small express wagon so she wrote to me
being aware of my unusual ability in the line of selecting suitable
express wagons for little colored boys

but listen nat exclaimed dorothy eagerly i wrote to dalton a week
ago today sent a special delivery stamp for a quick reply and i
havent heard a word since

oh thats it you sent a special stamp that was where you made a big
mistake miss tavia wanted to write to that girl in buffalo had been
putting it off as usual and when she saw your blue stamp it brought her
the inspiration she wrote to dolly if dolly is her name used your
stamp and dolly answered come tavia went there you are now what
do you think of me as a wireless sleuth

do you really think tavia is in buffalo asked dorothy endeavoring to
bring her cousin down to a commonsense viewpoint

sure of it but say doro ill tell you what ill just take a fly in
the fire bird tomorrow morning and find out for you for sure that will
be better than the special delivery boy on his bicycle that never moves
ill be back by lunch time

oh that will be splendid cried dorothy giving her cousins arm a
tight squeeze you see i could not trust another letter and im so
anxious to know oh nat you are the very best cousin 

not so bad interrupted nat when it comes to special messengers but
little cousin you can depend on me i wont let any one hold up the
automobile mail coach




                              chapter xiii
                             little urania


the soft moonlight was now peeping through the screen of maple leaves
that arched the old stone bridge as the shifting shadows of early
evening settled down to quiet nightfall dorothy and her cousin did not
at once turn their steps toward the cedars instead they sat there on the
bridge enjoying the tranquil summer eve and talking of what might
happen when all their schooldays would be over and the long vacation of
the grownup world would be theirs to plan for and theirs to shape into
the rolling ball of destiny

nat declared he would be a physician as that particular profession had
ever been to him the greatest and noblest to relieve human suffering
dorothy talked of staying home with her brothers and father they would
need her she said and it would not be fair to let aunt winnie do so
much for them

but i say dorothy broke in nat this moonlight is all right isnt
it

dorothy laughed at his attempt at sentimentality it is delightful she
replied if that is what you mean

yes thats it delightful for real homemade sentiment apply to nat
white by the pound or barrel accept no substitute good thing i did not
decide to be a writer eh the elements represent to me so many kinds of
chemical bodies put where they belong and each one expected to do its
little part in keeping things going now i know fellows who write about
the moons face and the suns effulgence just as if the poor old sun or
moon had anything to do with the lightingup process i never speculate
on things beyond my reach that sort of thing is too hazy for mine

now nat you know very well you are just as sentimental as any one
else didnt you write some verses once

verses oh yes but i didnt get mixed with the stars you will
remember it was ned who said

  the stars were shining clear and bright
  when it rained like time that fearful night

i was the only one who stood by ned when he penned that stanza it could
rain like time and be a fearful night while the stars were shining in
china oh yes that was a great composition but i didnt happen to win
out

the school test of versification to which both had reference brought
back pleasant memories and dorothy and nat enjoyed the retrospection

what is that asked dorothy suddenly as something stirred at the side
of the bridge on the slope that led to the water

muskrat or a snake suggested nat indifferently

no listen that sounded like someone falling down the path

a nice soft fall to them then remarked nat without showing signs of
intending to make an investigation

ask if anyone is there timidly suggested dorothy

at this nat jumped up and looked over the culvert

there sure is some one sliding down he said hi there want any
help

a stone slipped under my foot came back the answer and the voice was
unmistakably that of a young girl or a child

wait a minute called nat ill get down there and give you a hand

the path to the brook led directly around the bridge and it took but a
moment for the boy to make his way to the spot whence the voice came
dorothy could scarcely distinguish the two figures that kept so close to
the bridge as to be in danger of sliding under the stone arch

there called nat get hold of my hand i have a good grip on a strong
limb and can pull you up

but it required a sturdy arm to hold on to the tree branch and pull the
girl up several times nat lost his footing and slid some distance but
the street level was finally gained and the strange girl brought to the
road in safety

the moonlight fell across her slim figure and revealed the outlines of a
very queer little creature indeed she was dark with all the
characteristics of the gypsy marked in her face

dorothy and nat surveyed her critically whatever could a child of her
age be doing all alone there in that deserted place after nightfall

thanks said the girl to nat as she rubbed her bare feet on the damp
grass i almost fell

almost repeated nat i thought you did fall you must have hit that
big rock there i know it for i used to fish from the same place and
its not exactly a divan covered with sofa cushions

yes i did hit my side on it admitted the girl but it doesnt hurt
much

what is your name asked dorothy stepping closer to the stranger

urania but im going to change it i dont believe in urania any more

then you are a gypsy girl spoke nat i thought id seen you before

yes they say im a gypsy girl but im tired of the business and im
going away

where asked dorothy

any place as long as its not back to camp i left it tonight and im
never going back to it again never never and the girl shook her
disheveled head in very positive emphasis

why asked dorothy youre too young to be out alone and at night you
must be frightened arent you

frightened and the girl laughed derisively what is there to be
afraid of i know all the snakes and toads besides the birds

arent there tramps inquired nat

perhaps but it would take a slick tramp to catch me gypsy girls know
how to run if they cant read and write

it seemed to dorothy that this remark was tinged with bitterness as if
the girl evidently felt the loss of education

but you had better run back to the camp like a good girl pleaded nat
come well walk part of the way with you

back to the camp you dont know what youre talking about ive started
out in the world for myself and could not go back now if i wanted to
that woman would beat me

what woman nat asked

the one my father married they call her melea she has her own little
girl and doesnt care for urania

but where will you stay tonight inquired dorothy now anxious that
the little gypsy would change her mind and run back to the camp at the
foot of the hill before it would be too late before she might be missed
from her usual place

i was going to sleep under the bridge replied urania calmly but when
i heard you talking i came out i love to hear pretty words

poor child thought dorothy like a little human fawn and she wants
to start out in the world for herself

i heard what you said about going to dalton urania said to nat as she
tried to hide her embarrassment by fingering her tattered dress and i
was wondering if you could let me ride in the back of your automobile i
want to go to the big city and its its a far walk isnt it

it would be a long walk to dalton replied nat in surprise but dalton
isnt a big city besides i could never help you to run away he
finished

some boys do urania remarked with a pout i know people who run away
they come to melea to have their fortunes told

nat and dorothy laughed at this it seemed queer that persons who would
run away would stop long enough to have their fortunes told by a gypsy

and couldnt i ride in the back of your automobile persisted the girl
not willing to let so good a chance slip past her too easily

im afraid not declared nat i wouldnt help you to run away in the
first place and in the second i never take any girls out riding
except my cousin and her friend

oh you dont eh sneered urania what about the one with the red
hair didnt i see you out with her one day when we were camping in the
mountains near that hightoned school glendale or glenwood or something
like that and didnt she come to our camp next day to have her fortune
told oh she wanted to start out in the world for herself you would
help her of course but poor urania she must die and the girl threw
herself down upon the grass and buried her head in the long wet spears

dorothy and nat were too surprised to answer surely the girl must refer
to tavia but tavia had never ridden out alone with nat not even while
he was at the automobile assembly near glenwood and tavia could scarcely
have gone to the fortune tellers camp

i say i have never taken out any girl without my mother or my cousin
being along nat said sharply recovering himself

then it was your girl with another fellow declared the wily gypsy not
willing to be caught in an untruth she arose from the grass and seeing
the telling expression on the faces of her listeners like all of her
cult she knew she had hit upon a fact of some kind

my girl repeated nat laughingly

yes was the quick answer she had bright pretty colored hair brown
eyes and her initials are o t i heard her tell melea so

the initials o t must surely be those of octavia travers thought
dorothy and nat but nat knew better than to press the subject further
this cunning girl in spite of her youth he was sure would make answers
to suit the questions and such freedom on the subject of tavia
especially now when there were enough rumors to investigate would
simply be inviting trouble

but dorothy was not so wise in her eagerness to hear more she wanted to
know if her chum had really gone to the gypsy camp from glenwood but she
would not deign to ask if tavia really went auto riding with some boys
who attended the meet that would be too mean even to think about and
besides thought dorothy suddenly tavia was sick during all the time of
the automobile assembly

i can tell you more if youll give me money boldly spoke urania i
know all her fortune i heard melea tell her i was outside the tent and
i heard every word

i thought that was against the practice of the gypsies said nat
severely

practice sneered the girl when a pretty girl comes to our camp i
always listen i like to find out what that kind think about to see if
they are different from urania

come said dorothy to nat we must go it is getting late

and you dont want to hear about the girl that is going to run away to a
circus called the gypsy as dorothy and nat turned away

no thank you not tonight replied nat youd better run home before
the constable comes along they put girls in jail for running away from
home

oh do they then your redheaded friend must be there now called back
the gypsy with unconcealed malice

what can she mean asked dorothy clinging to her cousins arm as they
hurried along

oh dont mind that imp she is just like all her kind trying to play
on your sympathies first and then using threats she was listening to us
talking and picked up all she told us she got the initials at
glenwood likely followed tavia and asked some other girl what her name
was i remember now there was a gypsy settlement there that parts true
enough

perhaps admitted dorothy with a sigh i know mrs pangborn positively
forbade all the girls to go near the gypsy camps but some of the pupils
might have met urania on the road

thats about it decided nat but she ought to stick to the game
shed make a good player the idea of waylaying us and pretending to have
fallen down

its hard to understand that class admitted dorothy but i hope
shell not stay out all night i should be worried if i awoke and heard
her walking about under the trees near my window

no danger declared nat i must go and see that the garage is locked
she might take a notion to turn the fire bird into a pullman sleeper

then leaving dorothy on the veranda with his mother nat went around to
the little auto shed fastened the door securely and put the key into his
pocket




                              chapter xiv
                              the runaway


dorothy was not sure whether she dreamed it or really heard sounds
stirring under the trees she had been thinking of the gypsy girl and
tavia as she fell asleep and when she suddenly awoke in the middle of
the night there seemed to be some one moving about just under the window
of her room it was so quiet that even faint sounds could be heard and
dorothy lay there listening for some time after being aroused presently
something banged like a blind being slammed back there was no breath of
wind surely someone must have opened the shutter

the moonlight came in through the casement and illuminated the room
enough for her to see to get up and reach her door it was but a step to
the boys apartment she would call them she decided but was most
anxious not to disturb her father or aunt

strange to say when dorothy had slipped on her dressing gown and slippers
and knocked at the door of the boys room she found them both awake for
they had answered her light tap at once a moment later they were in the
corridor attired in their big bath robes

im sure i heard a footstep at the side porch whispered dorothy

so did i answered ned ive been awake for a long time listening

perhaps you had better go down suggested dorothy nervously it might
be a tramp

tramp nothing declared nat boldly as he made his way softly to the
front door ill bet its our friend urania i was sure she would call
this evening

without the slightest fear the brothers opened the door and searched
about for a possible intruder they even looked under the lilac bush at
dorothys window but no midnight prowlers were discovered

dorothy bravely stood at the front door waiting to call for more help in
case the boys should need assistance but they finally returned from
their hunt more disgusted than alarmed dorothy was entirely satisfied
now that no one was about the place

i call that mean grumbled nat i was all primed for an adventure

you should be careful what sort of acquaintances you pick up after
dark cautioned ned your little urania may turn out troublesome if you
cross her gypsies have a way of making people pony up with the money
you know

dont wake the folks cautioned dorothy leading the way back to the
sleeping rooms im not a bit afraid now

well if she comes back again ask her in spoke nat in a hoarse
whisper i think urania needs a talking to

dorothy fell asleep again after listening for some time and was not
disturbed any further that night until the bright sun shining into her
windows called her to get up to begin another day

as they had planned nat was to start early for dalton he could easily
make some excuse for his solitary trip say that he wanted to see some
friends who were off camping or that he wanted to go fishing he
mentioned these two objects vaguely as he started off

dorothy warned him not to let an inkling of her fears concerning tavia
reach the ears of any one in dalton but there was no need for this as
nat was as anxious as was his cousin to keep the matter secret between
them

its an easy thing to start gossip in a place like dalton he whispered
to dorothy as he threw in the clutch to send the auto on its way and
you can depend upon me to give them another think if theyre looking
for news

as the fire bird swung out along the path nat turned to wave a reassuring
goodbye to dorothy who stood on the porch watching him spin away

the morning which had begun so bright and pleasant now took on a gloomy
aspect for dorothy how could she wait for nats return and what would
he find out concerning tavia and her plans suppose she should really be
in buffalo that would not necessarily mean that she had gone away she
might be visiting her friend grace barnum

it seemed impossible for dorothy to become interested in anything save
nat and his mission she tried to sew but soon laid aside the dainty
little work basket aunt winnie had provided for the summer hours on the
porch then ned invited her to go bicycling and she had to make some
excuse for refusing the invitation even writing some letters for the
major did not distract her and she could think of nothing but nat and
his trip to dalton

but somehow the morning wore on and it was almost time for nat to
return as dorothy knew in his swift car he could make the journey in
record time over the good roads

but im sure something will delay him said dorothy to herself i feel
as if something will surely happen

and a wellgrounded fear it was for meanwhile something was happening
to nat something quite unexpected

having reached in due time dalton and the little cottage where the
travers family dwelt nat steered the machine up in front of the door
then he remembered he had to tighten the bolt of the clutch pedal and
decided to do it before making his inquiries as it was important that
the pedal be tight he turned back to the machine from which he had
jumped to get his wrench from the tool box under the rear seat he
unbuttoned the leather curtain that reached down to the floor of the
tonneau and was feeling about for the wrench when he started back in
surprise

there under the seat stretched out so as to be concealed while the
curtain was down was urania the gypsy girl the confined space made her
hump up like an angry cat and her dark face peered sharply into nats
from under the leather flap

for a moment nat could not find words to speak to the girl who remained
in her hiding place grinning out at him with a mocking look on her elfin
face

hello she exclaimed presently i had a lovely ride

get out of there instantly exclaimed nat in angry tones how in the
world did you ever get in there

oh easy enough you locked the door but you left the shed window open
last night and i crawled in i was almost a goner though when you and
your brother came out on the porch looking for spooks i was just trying
your hammock then thats a softer cradle than this stuffy place

i guess id better hand you over to a constable went on nat realizing
what it might mean to try to drag the girl from her hiding place just
then

oh dont trouble yourself was the cool answer i believe ive had
enough of riding and id like to stretch out a bit

by this time the travers family had become aware of the presence of the
fire bird at their door and mrs travers impressed with the
distinction had stepped back quickly to her room to tidy herself up a
bit this gave nat a few moments longer to think of what he had best do
with the gypsy girl

here he said to her rather fiercely you just stay under that seat
until im ready to take you to a place of safety now if you dare to
move while im in this house ill ill have you arrested and with that
nat fastened down the curtain securely with a catch that snapped on the
outside and was incapable as he supposed of being opened from the
inside

he walked up the path to the front door and after a few seconds his
knock was answered by mrs travers with unlimited protestations of
welcome she showed nat in and offered him a seat in the far corner of
the room some distance from the front windows he felt that he had
better keep his eye on the machine because of his concealed passenger
so after a moments hesitation he took a chair near the front of the
apartment remarking as he did so what a pretty view there was from the
window

what brings you to dalton asked mrs travers

i was er just passing through and i thought id stop to inquire about
the family dorothy would like to know said nat

oh were about as well as usual said tavias mother

hows tavia is she home asked nat quickly feeling that this was as
good an opening as he could desire

no and im very sorry for shed be delighted to see you she went to
buffalo just after coming from school we scarcely had a good look at
her i wanted her to stay home for a week but she was so set on going
that she started off bag and baggage and im sure i cant say when she
will be home of course shes with friends the mother hastened to add
seeing the look of surprise that flashed over neds face in spite of his
effort at selfcontrol

my cousin dorothy wrote to her nat hastened to say to cover his
confusion and not receiving an answer thought it likely that she
might be ill or away

tavias father forwarded the letter to her said mrs travers she
should have answered it by this time we have only had one souvenir card
from her since she went away but it was a real pretty one id like to
show it to you but i guess ive mislaid it i cant think where i put
it

never mind i suppose it takes some time for a letter to travel when
its been forwarded from one place to another i dare say dorothy will
soon hear from her im glad all the family are well major dale is
always glad to hear news of the dalton folks

and indeed we all miss the major spoke mrs travers with a show of
feeling not to say we dont miss the entire family for the boys were
fine little fellows and as for dorothy 

the intended tribute to dorothy ended with a little catch in mrs
traverss voice for she was very fond of her daughters companion and
sometimes showed her feelings with a touch of sentimentality

then as nat was really in a hurry for he could not stop thinking of
urania under the seat he made his excuses as quickly and as politely as
the circumstances would allow and was soon out of the house he lost no
time in cranking up and in a few minutes was chugchugging at top speed
down the country road

he had made up his mind to take the gypsy girl back to north birchland
and was vaguely wondering as he dashed along why she did not knock on
the seat and demand to be let out of her uncomfortable quarters

i think ill stop and just take a look at her she may be crying the
lad remarked to himself and bringing the machine to a halt alongside
the road he stepped out

he assumed a determined look before unfastening the curtain for he was
bound not to let his sympathies run away with him in dealing with the
unruly girl he shoved back the catch and raised the leather flap

urania was gone

well ill be jiggered cried nat aloud so great was his astonishment
at the second surprise the gypsy had given him if she isnt a dandy
how in the world did she slip out without me seeing her

but nat had forgotten the few moments when he sat on the sofa at the rear
side of mrs traverss parlor some distance from the front windows and
it was in those few moments that urania had managed to undo the catch in
spite of its supposed security and slip out of the fire bird swiftly
as no girl but a gypsy can run she had fled down the street across the
dalton bridge and into the deep woods beyond where she would have time
to plan out the remainder of her days travels

well shes gone good riddance thought nat as he started up the
machine once more and turned at a swift speed into the turnpike
leading to north birchland




                               chapter xv
                        a spell of the glumps


whizzing along the road nat tried to decide how it would be best to break
the disappointing news to dorothy of his escapade with urania he had
fully determined not to say a word dorothy had enough girls to worry
about he argued and if she heard of this one she would form a searching
expedition and set out at once to hunt the gypsy who nat thought was
like a human squirrel and able to take care of herself

the return trip seemed shorter than that which took nat out to dalton
and as the fire bird swung into the cedars entrance somewhat later than
the youth expected to get back dorothy was at the gate awaiting to hear
news of tavia

buffalo announced nat sententiously as dorothy came up beside the car
which jerked to a stop amid a screeching of the brake she went there
some time ago shes at grace barnums wait i have the address

without delaying to put the machine up nat produced a slip of paper upon
which he had written at mrs traverss direction the street and number
of miss barnums residence he handed it to dorothy

do you think its all right asked dorothy looking at the directions

course it is everybody in dalton is as chipper as possible youre the
only one whos worrying now if i were you id just let up doro
youll be down sick if you dont

perhaps i am foolish and i have given you a lot of trouble spoke up
the girl a little sadly

trouble nothing exclaimed nat i just like the lark when you want
any more sleuthing done apply at headquarters im the gumshoe man for
this section and at that he turned his attention to the fire bird
while dorothy walked thoughtfully back to the house

poor dorothy an instinctive foreboding of danger had taken possession of
her now and try as she did to dispel it an unmistakable voice seemed
to call out to her

find tavia she needs you dorothy dale

perhaps thought dorothy she has run away and is really with some
circus troupe as the gypsy girl said or perhaps she is at some watering
place taking part in a play 

this last possibility was the one that dorothy dreaded most to dwell
upon tavia must have loved the stage else why did she constantly do the
things she did at school so like a little actress and so like a girl
stagestruck as aunt winnie called it

these and similar fancies floated through dorothys brain hour after
hour in spite of whatever diversion presented itself for her amusement

the afternoon following nats trip to dalton dorothy with her
brothers roger and joe went to gather pond lilies near the waterfall
it was a delightful day and the sun glistened on the quiet sheet of the
mill pond making liquid diamonds the lilies of which there was an
abundance looked like carved wax that had frozen the suns gold in each
heart but somehow dorothy could not work up her usual enthusiasm in
gathering the blossoms

it was delightful to dip her hands into the cool stream and surely to
hear little roger prattle was an inspiration but all the while dorothy
was thinking of crowded buffalo and wondering what a certain girl might
be doing there on that summer afternoon

in the evening major dale and mrs white taking dorothy with them went
for a drive along the broad boulevard that was the pride of that
exclusive summer place north birchland dorothy tried bravely to rouse
herself from her gloomy reveries but in spite of her efforts mrs white
complained that her niece was not like her usual self perhaps not
feeling well she ventured

im glumpy ever since i left glenwood admitted dorothy not because
i want to be nor that i am not having a most delightful time but i
simply have the glumps at glenwood they prescribe extra work for an
attack like this and the girl laughed at her own diagnosis

you certainly should dispel the glumps said mrs white i cant
imagine what could produce an attack here at the cedars with all your
own folks around you dorothy dear i do believe you are lonely for
those impossible girls what do you say to paying some of them a little
visit just to break in on your holiday

really aunty protested dorothy i am perfectly content what sort of
girl would i be to want to run away and leave you all after being away so
long at school no indeed ill stay right here at the beautiful cedars
and ill try to be a better girl to get rid at once of my spell of the
glumps as we used to call them at glenwood

but girls are girls insisted her aunt and you have no control my
dear over such sentiment as i imagine you are afflicted with at present
just plan out a little trip somewhere and ill vouch for it the visit
to some giggling dolly varden of a girl will do you no end of good and
then too you may invite her back here with you

mrs white divined too well the reason for dorothys blue spell she
could see perfectly how much her niece missed the lighthearted tavia
and in advising her to take a little trip mrs white was sure dorothy
would choose to go where her chum might be

in this she was right but concerning what dorothy might do to reach
tavia mrs white had no idea she merely suggested a little trip
somewhere believing dorothy would find tavia either in dalton or
visiting some girl friend as dorothy had told her tavia intended doing
but circumstances conspired to give dorothy the very opportunity she
longed for she would go somewhere anywhere to look for her
sisterfriend the girl who had been to her more than friend and almost
a sister

ned and nat had planned a trip to buffalo at the beginning of their
vacation they were to meet a number of their chums there and do some
exploring in the neighborhood of niagara falls they were to make the
journey in the fire bird and when mrs white suggested a trip for
dorothy it was the run to buffalo in the automobile that immediately
came into the girls mind

if i only could go with the boys she pondered but what excuse would
i have

all the next day she turned the subject over in her mind then something
very remarkable happened persons who believe in thought controlling
matter would not call the incident out of the ordinary perhaps but be
that as it may when dorothy strolled down to the postoffice having a
slender hope of a letter from tavia she did find a letter in the box a
letter from rosemary markin stating that she and her mother were
going to buffalo and niagara falls for a few days and as buffalo was
only about a days trip from north birchland perhaps dorothy could take
a run to buffalo and spend a few days with them

dorothys head thumped when she read the letter the very thing of all
others she would have wished for had she been as wise as the unknown
fate that worked it out for her without any action on her own part

she felt light enough now to fly over the road back to the cedars to
show the invitation to mrs white the boys were to leave for buffalo the
next day so there was little time to be lost should major dale and mrs
white think it best for dorothy to make the trip how the girl trembled
while waiting for the decision what if she should be disappointed it
was a long ride in the auto but with her cousins 

mrs white read rosemarys little note a second time while dorothy stood
there waiting the aunt noticed how delicately rosemary indicated her
own mothers anxiety to meet dorothy and then with what a nicety the
whole matter was referred to major dale and dorothys aunt this
carefully written note neither stilted nor indifferent in its tone
convinced mrs white at once that the writer was exactly the girl dorothy
had described her to be her very best friend at glenwood excepting only
tavia

well i dont see why you cant go with the boys spoke her aunt
finally they are always careful and if you leave here as they intend
to do at sunrise that will be an experience for you you should get
into buffalo in time for the evening dinner ill just sound the major
giving dorothy a loving embrace not that a mere man even be he major
dale can hold out against two such sampsonlike wills as ours

from that moment until the time of her stepping into the fire bird next
morning and waving a goodbye to the little party that stood on the
porch to see them off it all seemed like the strangest subtlest dream
to dorothy she was going to find tavia going herself to look for her
and find out for herself all the questions that for weeks had been
eating away her happiness with dreaded uncertainties




                              chapter xvi
                           dorothy in buffalo


and now remarked ned after they had skimmed along for awhile i
suppose dorothy you cant deny me the longlooked for opportunity of
meeting the sweetest girl in glenwood according to you
cologne rosemary markin to be exact

oh i know you will like her ned she certainly is a very sweet girl
replied dorothy

the very thing for me i have been looking for that brand for some time
and now o edward prepare thyself

mind your wheel cried nat for ned had raised his right hand in the
air to give emphasis to his dramatic utterance and came close to a large
stone save that for later

dorothy was as bright and animated as possible during the trip and
chatted with the boys about the glenwood girls giving a full share of
praise to cologne after all dorothy reflected ned was a young man
handsome and in many ways desirable and it would be nice if he were
to take the two girls around buffalo but this thought was overshadowed
by another if tavia were only with them what good times they might have
tavia and nat always got along so well together each seemed to be an
inspiration of mirth to the other

but tavia

nat seemed quiet and even serious as they speeded along the lonely
country roads his brother was not slow to notice the unusual look of
concern and attempted to jolly it away

cheer up nat he said the worst is yet to come and he made a wry
face you know we expect to find your little friend somewhere out this
way i really wouldnt want a corner on happiness i do feel somehow
that cologne will be my fate but that is no reason why you and doro
shouldnt hitch on to the band wagon let me see doro you say she has
brown eyes and blue hair 

ned you must not make fun of cologne 

fun of her as soon bite my own tongue i said it sideways by mistake
it should have read blue eyes and brown hair wasnt that it

yes thats more like it admitted dorothy and she has the most
adorable little mouth 

oh here nat get hold of this wheel i really must have a chance to
think that over say it again dorothy please and the lad went through
a series of queer antics that seem so very funny when the right boy
attempts to be funny but so very flat when one tries to either describe
them or imitate the original

and isnt there a brother in this visit to buffalo asked nat drolly

in spite of herself the color flew to dorothys cheeks of course
rosemary had a brother two years older than herself but dorothy had
never met him although rosemary talked so much at school of jack that
dorothy almost felt acquainted with the youth but now she would
certainly meet the family for they were all together at the buffalo
hotel

oh yes chimed in ned isnt there a brother

yes answered dorothy i believe there is

now i call that real jolly went on ned just one apiece if nat finds
tavia of course

a few hours later the fire bird swung up to the portico of a leading
buffalo hotel and scarcely had the puffing machine come to a stop than
a girl in lavender with blue eyes and brown hair had dorothy in her
arms

oh you dear old sweetheart exclaimed rosemary as she embraced
dorothy with that effusion of delight peculiar to schoolgirls and babies
as nat remarked in a whisper to ned

and you were so good to think of me dorothy tried to say from the
midst of the embrace

think of you as if i ever forgot you for one single moment then
rosemary turned to the two boys in the auto and paused

these are my cousins began dorothy this is mr edward white and the
other one with a little laugh is his brother nathaniel

the boys bowed and made what were probably intended for complimentary
acknowledgments of the introduction but which were mere murmurs
rosemary however with the usual advantage of girls over boys in such
matters showed no embarrassment

there is one real nice thing about dorothy spoke nat when he had in a
measure recovered his composure she always makes ned my brother that
counts

the girls laughed merrily and then a tall young man the very image of
rosemary only taller according to dorothy stepped down to the curb

jack called rosemary come here instanter and get acquainted with
dorothy

jack looked at the group his eyes plainly said only with dorothy

oh help yourself help yourself cried ned laughing at the confusion
colognes speech had caused we will be among those present if you
like

now you know very well what i mean and rosemary shot a challenging
look at ned i want you all to be the very best of friends 

thanks thanks exclaimed nat as he and his brother bowed in mock
deference we promise i assure well do our best

oh boys are all just alike stammered dorothys host a pack of
teases come along dorothy mother is waiting to welcome you jack
perhaps you will tell dorothys cousins what to do with their machine i
guess you know how to get acquainted with them without any more
introductions

this last was said with a defiant look at ned who returned it with just
the suspicion of a smile in effect his look said

miss lavender you have met a boy who may be like other boys but he is
particularly himself ned white and he just loves to tease girls like
you

rosemary was leading dorothy up the broad steps to the hotel entrance
she turned to see what the boys were doing

well i declare she exclaimed there theyve all gone for a ride im
sure theyll have a jolly time what nice boys your cousins are oh im
so glad you could come

the hotel veranda was thronged with persons enjoying the approach of
twilight for the auto party had not made a hurried trip having stopped
for lunch on the way it seemed to dorothy that the chairs were mostly
filled with stout ladies with blond hair she had never before seen so
many blonds in one group

rosemary led the way into the parlor and escorted dorothy up to a
smiling pretty woman with such beautiful white hair the kind that goes
with brown eyes and seems to add to their sparkle

mother dear this is dorothy said rosemary she must be tired after
her long dusty ride shall we go upstairs

im so glad to meet you my dear declared mrs markin warmly
daughter talks so much about you yes rosie do take dorothy upstairs
and let her refresh herself it must be a very long ride from north
birchland

but im not the least tired protested the visitor so dont go
upstairs if you were enjoying the air

air indeed echoed rosemary slipping her arm through dorothys
mother will you come

no dear replied mrs markin ill let you have dorothy all to
yourself for awhile i just know how many things you will want to talk
about later after dinner ill claim you both but im going to improve
this time to write a few belated letters the desk is clear so i can do
them down here

rosemary left dorothy while she made a place for her mother at the
little private desk in the ladies sitting room then the two girls took
the elevator in the broad hall and soon dorothy found herself in a cozy
room with a dainty white bed and pretty flouncings rosemarys
apartment of course which she had surrendered to her guest for the
visit while cologne would share her mothers room

now make yourself comfortable began rosemary assisting dorothy to
lay aside her auto wraps perhaps you want to wash here are the
things and she pulled open a little door disclosing a bathroom

isnt it charming here dorothy said as she at once began to make
herself presentable for dinner i have a blue dress in my bag
indicating one the porter had brought up

drag it out commanded her companion you must wear blue i have told
jack how heavenly you look in blue

and i have whispered to ned how angelic you look in lavender
interrupted dorothy not to be outdone in bestowing compliments isnt
ned a lovely boy

very saucy i should say and cologne laughed mischievously but ill
try to be nice to him on your account

and i hope ill not say anything to hurt jacks feelings spoke
dorothy still keeping in with her friends humor

couldnt he hasnt any declared rosemary he drives me frantic when
i really want to make him mad

but you do look lovely in that lavender gown insisted dorothy with
unmistakable admiration i believe you have grown prettier 

comparative degrees eh and she made a queer little face now doro
dear you must say ive grown positively handsome i will never be
content with the little insignificant comparative degree in a suite of
rooms like these arent they really scrumptious you know dad couldnt
come and he was so anxious that we would be comfortable that the dear
old darling just wired for good rooms and thats how we got these
theyre good arent they

dorothy looked out of the broad window down at the big city stretched
before her view she could not help thinking of tavia although she
thought it best not to speak of her to rosemary just yet at least
cologne was busy hanging up the things she had pulled out of dorothys
bag

how long can you stay she asked shaking out dorothys light blue
linen frock

well it was the queerest thing aunt winnie got it into her head that i
needed some of the girls and she proposed a little trip for me just as
your letter came it seemed providential

providential thats what i call dead lucky girlie you cant expect a
real proper providence to get mixed up in all our little scrapes and to
be honest im just dying for a real genuine scrape the kind tavia used
to hand out to us at glenwood

dorothy smiled but did not reply somehow the idea of tavia still being
kept busy handing out scrapes struck her as somewhat significant

presently the boys returned which fact was made known by a shrill
whistle over the private telephone in the apartment and jacks voice
following with a command for rosie to come down

the girls found the three boys and mrs markin waiting for them ned and
nat having declined jacks invitation to take dinner with him at the
hotel they said they had to be off to meet the youths with whom they had
arranged to stop while in buffalo

dorothy wanted so much to ask nat to take her to look for tavia she felt
she would not sleep until she found the house of tavias friend grace
barnum but she was too uncertain of tavias whereabouts to say openly
that she wanted to go to the address that nat had brought her from mrs
travers

the fire bird had been left in quarters provided by the boys of the get
there club members of which were to be neds and nats guests and the
two birchland youths were thus free to walk about the big city that
evening perhaps dorothy might also go for a walk with rosemary and
jack

but dorothy as she reflected on this possibility realized that it
would not afford her an opportunity of getting to grace barnums it
would not do for the entire party to go there dorothy felt as she could
never allow any one to suspect her anxiety concerning tavia only nat was
in the secret so far and even he was not made fully aware of all it
involved and of its depth he did not know why dorothy was so anxious or
that she had any other than a foolish schoolgirl whim urging her on

so in spite of all the surroundings and excitement incident to life in
a big hotel with its many strange phases dorothy kept turning the
question over and over in her mind how should she go about her search
for tavia just as she expected the party planned to go out that first
evening of her visit to look over the town all were going except mrs
markin and she consented to let the young folks enjoy themselves without
her chaperonage on account of the circumstances and the number who were
going

ned and nat both essayed to look after rosemary and this added to the
merrymaking since when one lad would attempt some courtesy the other
would immediately undertake to outdo him dorothy found jack markin
splendid company and this she told herself could not be otherwise
since he was brother to cologne

at a pretty palmfestooned icecream parlor they met a friend of the
markin family alma mason who was also a visitor in buffalo she was
bright and interesting chatting pleasantly on many subjects until to
dorothys surprise she asked abruptly

do you happen to know a grace barnum

no dorothy answered as she felt her face burning with excitement i
do not know her personally but she is a friend of a chum of mine

the pretty girl with the goldenbrown hair oh i have met her alma
went on taking dorothys look to signify the correctness of the guess
that the pretty girl with the brown hair was dorothys friend isnt
she splendid grace was just wild over her she was so jolly and funny

that miss mason used the past tense dorothy instantly noticed nat was
also listening with interest and he observed the same thing

is she not with miss barnum now dorothy found courage to inquire
finally

no i think not i think grace said she had gone to rochester she has
i believe a friend in that city

dorothy was startled at the news that tavia had left buffalo her heart
sank but she tried to conceal her feelings tavia in rochester the girl
in rochester was she who had once written tavia concerning the stage and
its attractions and tavia possibly was with her after she had promised
to have no further correspondence with that press agent

the remainder of the evening was like a blank page to dorothy she heard
and saw what was going on around her but her heart and her attention was
not with the merry little party from the hotel jack markin would have
accused her of being dull had he not determined to meet more than half
way his sisters estimate of dorothy dale then too he reasoned as an
excuse for her obvious low spirits she must be tired after the long
dusty auto run

the evening passed quickly to all but dorothy amid a variety of
entertainments and when the boys from north birchland said goodnight in
the hotel office and rosemary had taken dorothy to her room it was
quite late

it was a relief however dorothy had to admit to herself at least and
in her heart she was grateful to mrs markin when that lady cautioned the
two girls against further talking and urged dorothy to go to bed for
dorothy wanted to be alone and think she wanted to plan how should she
proceed now if tavia was not with grace barnum 

but of this she must first make certain and to do so she would ask nat
to take her to miss barnums house the first thing next morning




                              chapter xvii
                              at the play


but little light was thrown on the disappearance of tavia through any
information dorothy could obtain from grace barnum in fact that young
lady was quite as puzzled as was dorothy and when told that tavia was
not to be found at home a few days previous this being within the time
when tavia had left buffalo ostensibly for her residence in dalton miss
barnum wanted to communicate immediately with the missing girls parents

nat with kind consideration had declined to step inside when dorothy
called at the barnum home he thought he might better give the two young
ladies a chance to discuss the situation alone and so under pretense of
strolling through the little park opposite the house left grace and
dorothy together

it took the girls but a moment to arrive at the same point of interest
grace showed keenest anxiety when dorothy inquired for tavia for she had
fears of her own since her friends visit

i must write at once she insisted what would mrs travers think of
me if anything happened to tavia

but i have already begun a letter stated dorothy truthfully enough
so perhaps i had better make the inquiry you know how excitable mrs
travers is perhaps i could write without causing her any alarm whereas
she would surely expect you to know whether or not tavia was home i
havent the slightest doubt but that she is home now dorothy hastened
to add i am expecting her at north birchland any day

this had the effect of putting grace at her ease of course she
reflected tavia might even be at the cedars now as her mother had given
her permission to go about almost as she wished and she had expected to
pay a number of visits to friends no special time being set for them
this grace knew for she had seen a letter to that effect from mrs
travers to tavia

you see said dorothy rising to go they have always given tavia so
much her own way she has been well sort of superior to the others at
home that i think is a real mistake for a girl is expected to know
more of the world and its ways than is consistent with her actual
experience

exactly admitted grace that is what i thought once when tavia acted
so well so selfreliant i do hope she is safe at home you will let me
know wont you dorothy i may call you that maynt i i feel as if i
had known you for a long time as tavia has talked so much about you

so the two girls parted and dorothys heart seemed to grow heavier at
each new turn in her quest for the missing one

why should tavia act so she asked herself over and over again as she
walked along with nat who tried to cheer her up

if you dont stop worrying doro he counseled as he noted the look of
anxiety on her face youll be a sick girl way out here in buffalo

im going to be excused from the party tonight she answered i
really have a headache and i must have time to write some letters

great headache cure letter writing but i suppose youll not rest until
you sift this matter to the very bottom and to be honest doro i cant
say i blame you id give a whole lot right now to know where the wily
tavia tarries

as discreetly as she could dorothy wrote the letter to mrs travers to
ask the mooted question she did not say she had been to grace barnums
but simply inquired for tavias address on an early mail the next day a
remarkable thing for mrs travers to answer a letter so promptly came
the reply that tavia was at the barnums there was some other news of
dalton in the epistle but that concerning tavia which her mother had
apparently set down as a matter of fact stood out prominently from all
the rest

in spite of her fears when the letter presented the actual fact that
tavia was not at home and as dorothy knew she was not at graces it
came like a shock to the girl already in a highly nervous state because
of what she had gone through hoping against hope she had clung to the
slim possibility that some explanation might come from dalton but now
even this was shattered

one thing dorothy quickly decided upon she must have another talk with
alma mason and she must be careful not to excite suspicion as to the
real purpose of the conversation

realizing at once that she must now move cautiously in the matter for
the slightest intimation that tavia was away from home and friends
without either the latter or relatives having a clue to her whereabouts
would be sure to ruin tavias reputation dorothy now determined that
even nat should not know of her plans for continuing the search

how hopeless dorothy felt all alone in such a work but find tavia she
must and to find her very soon she felt was imperative for even in
buffalo with her friends dorothy could see the dangers of a large city
to an unprotected and unsuspecting young girl

but the boys were going back to north birchland the next day how could
dorothy act in time to get to rochester for to rochester she felt that
she now must go everything pointed to the fact that tavia was either
there or that there a clue to her whereabouts could be obtained

on taking her morning walk alone for rosemary was a little indisposed
after the party of the evening previous dorothy met miss mason it was
not difficult to renew the conversation concerning tavia bit by bit alma
told of tavias infatuation for the stage until dorothy became more than
ever convinced that it was in theatrical surroundings that the missing
girl would be found

mrs markin had planned a little theatre party for rosemary and some of
her buffalo friends that afternoon the play was one especially
interesting to young girls a drama built on lines showing how one
ambitious girl succeeded in the world with nothing but a kind heart and a
worthy purpose to start with it abounded in scenes of rural home life
wholesome and picturesque and one of the features most conspicuous in
the advertising on the billboards was that of the character katherine
the heroine holding a neighborhood meeting in a cornfield among the
laborers during the noon hour the girl appeared in the posters perched
upon a water barrel and from that pulpit in the open she as the daughter
of a blind chair caner won hearts to happiness with the gospel of
brotherly love the new religion of the poor and the oppressed

while rosemary and alma enthused over the prospect of a particularly
pleasant afternoon dorothy seemed nervous and it was with some
misgivings that she finally agreed to attend the party that was really
arranged for her special entertainment the boys ned nat and jack were
going of course and to make the affair complete rosemary had also
invited grace barnum

grace was a particularly bright girl the sort that cares more for books
than pretty clothes and who had the temerity to wear her hair parted
directly in the middle in the very wildest of pompadour days not that
grace lacked beauty for she was of the classic type that seems to defy
nationality to such an extent that it might be a matter of most
uncertain guess to say to what country her ancestors had belonged

this neutrality was a source of constant delight to grace for each new
friend would undertake to assign her to a different country and so she
felt quite like the real thing in cosmopolitan types as she expressed
it the fact however might have been accounted for by the incident of
grace having been born under missionary skies in china her mother was an
american blond her father a dark foreigner of french and spanish
ancestry and with all this there was in the barnum family a distinct
strain of puritan stock from which the name barnum came grace being
distinctly different from other girls no doubt attracted tavia to her
and now when received among tavias friends she was welcomed with marked
attention that at once established a bond of friendship between her and
the other girls

the boys naturally were not slow to discover her so that altogether
the little matinee party when it had reached the theatre was a very
merry throng of young people mrs markin acted as chaperone and five
minutes before the time set for the play to begin dorothy and her friends
sat staring at the green fireproof curtain from a roomy box dorothy was
like one in a dream

all about her the others were eagerly waiting looking the while at the
programmes but dorothy sat there with the pink leaflet lying unheeded in
her lap

how much that picture of katherine resembles tavia was the thought
that disturbed her the same hair the same eyes what if it should be
she

the curtain was swaying to and fro as those behind it brushed past in
their preparations for the presentation of katherine the chair caners
daughter

dorothys heart beat wildly when she fancied tavia amid such scenes tavia
the openhearted girl the little dalton wild flower as dorothy liked
to call her surely no stage heroine could be more heroic than she had
always been in her role of shedding happiness on all who came within her
sphere of life

suddenly rosemary turned to nat and remarked

how tavia would enjoy this she looked around on the gay scene as the
theatre was filling up what a pity we could not bring her with us for
the good time

dorothy felt her face flush as nat made some irrelevant reply jack
turned directly to dorothy and noting her inattention to the programme
opened his to point out some of the items of interest

but still dorothy stared nervously at the big asbestos curtain and made
feeble efforts to answer her companions questions even mrs markin
observed dorothys rather queer manner and she too showed concern that
her daughters guest should be ill at ease

arent you well dear she asked quietly

dorothy fumbled with a lace flounce on her sleeve

yes she answered but there is so much to see and think about she
felt as if she were apologizing i am not accustomed to city theatres
she added

then the orchestra broke into the opening number and presently a flash
of light across the curtain told that the players were ready to begin

the introductory scenes were rather of an amateur order a poor country
home the blind chair caner at work and his more or less amusing
customers one flashilydressed woman wanted him to put a rush bottom in
a chair that had belonged to her grandmother but absolutely refused to
pay even the very low price the caner asked for the work she wanted it
as cheaply as though rush bottoms could be made by machinery he was poor
and needed work but he could not accept her terms

the woman in a red silk gown with a bewildering shower of veils floating
about her did not gain any applause for her part in the play dorothy
noted that even on the stage undesirable persons do not please and that
the assumed character is taken into account as well as their acting

it was when the blind man sat alone at his door step with his sightless
eyes raised pitifully to the inviting sunset that the pretty katherine
came skipping into view across the footlights

instinctively nat reached out and without being observed grasped
dorothys hand how like tavia he mused while dorothy actually seemed
to stop breathing from that moment to the very end of the play nat and
dorothy shared the same thought it might be tavia the others had each
remarked the resemblance but being more interested in the drama than in
the whereabouts of dorothys chum whom they had no occasion to worry
about for they did not know the circumstances they merely dwelt on it
as a passing thought they were interested in what happened to the chair
caners daughter

at last every member of the company found some excuse to get on the
stage and then the end was reached and the curtain went down while the
throng hurried out seemingly indifferent to the desire of the actors to
show themselves again as the curtain shot up for a final display of the
last scene

the markin party was to go to a restaurant for icecream and so hurried
from the box dorothy drifted along with them for a few moments and then
again that one thought came to her overwhelming her

what if that should really be tavia

she had but a moment to act then when the crowd pressed closer and
there was difficulty in walking because of the blockade dorothy slipped
back stepped out of her place and was at once swallowed up in a sea of
persons




                             chapter xviii
                           behind the scenes


for a moment dorothy felt as if she must make her way back after her
friends it was so terrifying to find herself in such a press but a glance
at the wavering canvas that now hid from the public the company of
players and helpers inspired her with new courage she would go behind
the scenes and see if that girl was tavia

in a short time the theatre was emptied save for the ushers and the boys
who dashed in and out among the rows of seats picking up the scattered
programmes and making the place ready for the evening performance one
of the ushers seeing dorothy walked over to her

waiting for anybody he asked mechanically without glancing up at her
but indicating that he was ready to turn up the seat before which she was
standing

yes replied dorothy

in the company he inquired next

yes the young lady who played katherine

this way the young man exclaimed snappily but in no unpleasant tone
he led the way along the row of seats down an isle and through a very
narrow door that seemed to be made of black oil cloth

dorothy had no time to think of what was going to happen it had all come
about so quickly she hardly knew how to proceed now what name to ask
for or whether or not to give her own in case it was demanded she
wondered what the actress would think of her if katherine did not turn
out to be tavia

you mean miss riceman the usher went on as he closed the narrow door
this way please and the next moment dorothy found herself behind
the scenes in a big city theatre

the place was a maze of doors and passageways wires and ropes were in a
seeming tangle overhead and all about were big wooden frames covered with
painted canvas scenes and flies that slid in and out at the two sides of
a stage and make up a very important part of a theatrical companys
outfit

these immense canvases seemed to be all over and every time dorothy
tried to walk toward a door indicated by her guide who had suddenly
disappeared she found she was in front of or behind some depiction of a
building or the side of a house or a street mechanics were busy all
about her

suddenly a girl thrust her head from one of the many doors and shouted to
an unseen person

nellie nellie dear im ready for that icecream soda get into your
street togs quick or youll be having soup instead 

nellie nellie came in a chorus from all sides though the owners of
the voices remained hidden and then there rang out through the big space
a spontaneous burst of a line from the chorus of the old song

  i was seeing nellie home i was seeing nellie home
  it was from aunt dinahs quilting party i was seeing nellie home

ha ha hows that nellie inquired a deep bass voice

dorothy stood for a moment not knowing what to do this was better than
the play she thought as she vaguely wondered what sort of life must be
led behind the scenes then the thought of her position sent a chill over
her she must seek out the performer who went by the name of miss
riceman and then 

by this time a number of the characters appeared from their dressing
rooms and dorothy stepped up to a girl with an enormous hat on her head
and a pair of very small shoes in her hand as the girl sank gracefully
down on an upturned box to adjust her ties and incidentally to get a
breath of air after the atmosphere of the stuffy dressing room dorothy
asked timidly

can you tell me where miss ricemans dressing room is

that first door to the left answered the girl tilting her big hat
back far enough to allow a glimpse of her questioner

dorothy stepped up to the door surely tavia could not be there
dorothys heart beat furiously she was trembling so she could hardly
knock but managed to give a faint tap

who called a girlish voice

miss dale answered dorothy mechanically feeling as if she would
almost be willing to give up her search for tavia if she could be well
out of the place there was a moments wait and then the door swung open

come in invited the girl from within the little room oh youre
miss let me see im afraid ive forgotten your name youre from the
leader arent you

no replied dorothy breathing easier now that she found herself alone
with a girl a simple human being just like any other girl i am looking
for for a friend she went on stammeringly and i thought perhaps you
could tell me 

you poor child interrupted miss riceman whose toilet was so
unceremoniously interrupted just come in and sit down on this trunk
then let me get you something you actually look ill

im just just a little fri frightened dorothy gasped for indeed she
was now feeling queer and dizzy and it was all getting black before her
eyes

nettie called the actress get me some cold water and call to the
girls in the lair and see if they have made coffee hurry now to the
woman who helped the actresses dress then she offered dorothy a bottle
of smelling salts take a whiff of that she said kindly the woman
will be back soon with some ice water im sorry youre not well was it
the smell from the gas lights i dont see why they make us poor
actresses put up with them when they have electric light in front its
abominable and the smoke from the powder they use to make the lightning
it fairly chokes me and she blew aside a curling wreath of vapor that
sifted in through the door a moment later the woman handed in a pitcher
of water and a glass no coffee in answer to some message well all
right

the actress flew over to a box that served as a dresser and poured out a
glass of water for dorothy as she did so dorothy had a chance to look at
katherine whom she imagined might be tavia there was not the slightest
resemblance now that the actress had her makeup off how could a
little paint powder and the glare from the footlights perform such a
miracle thought dorothy this girl was as different from tavia as
dorothy was herself and yet she did look so like her 

heres a nice drink of water spoke miss riceman

now please dont let me bother you so pleaded dorothy sitting up
determinedly and trying to look as if nothing was the matter but she
sipped the water gladly im quite well now thank you miss riceman
and ill not detain you a moment longer from your dressing

nonsense child sit still you wont bother me the least bit ill go
right on now tell me who it is youre looking for

dorothy watched the actress toss aside a mass of brown hair that was so
like tavias then she saw a string pulled and the wig came off the
real naturally blond hair of miss riceman fell in a shower over her
shoulders

turning to dorothy the performer instantly realized that the scene was
new to her visitor and with that strange subtle instinct which seems to
characterize the artistic professional woman she at once relieved the
situation by remarking

do you know we never feel like removing our makeup before the
reporters even women representatives of the press and of course we
never admit any others to our dressing rooms have such a funny way of
describing things that i should be mortally afraid of taking off my wig
before one i thought you were miss oh whats her name i never can think
of it from the leader i expected her to call but do you know that
women reporters are just the dearest set of rascals in the world they
simply cant help being funny when its a joke on you now whom did you
say you were looking for i do rattle on so

all this of course was giving dorothy time and she needed it badly for
her story was by no means ready for a dress rehearsal

but there was something so selfassuring about the actress she was not in
the least coarse or loudspoken she was on the contrary the very
embodiment of politeness dorothy felt she could talk freely with her
about tavia

i am looking for a young girl named octavia travers began dorothy
bravely and i thought possibly she might be with this company

was she with this company previously i dont seem to recall the name

oh i dont know that she is with any company dorothy hastened to add
feeling how foolish it must seem to be looking for a girl in a theatrical
troupe when one had no more assurance that she might be with such a
company than that she might be working in a department store

havent you her address asked miss riceman as she stood before the
glass daubing on some cold cream to remove the last of the makeup
from her face

no answered dorothy miserably enough i only wish i had

the actress with the cream jar turned around in time to see the tears
coming into dorothys eyes miss riceman dropped the jar down on her
improvised dresser and came over to where her visitor sat on the trunk

tell me all about it she said kindly sitting down beside dorothy
perhaps i can help you she is not your sister is she

no was the answer and then began a confidence of which dorothy had
scarcely believed herself capable she told how tavia was as much to her
as a sister could be and how she feared her chum had taken to the stage
on account of her peculiarities while at school then dorothy described
tavias appearance how pretty she was what beautiful hair she had

and her eyes dorothy almost cried i have never seen eyes like
tavias they are as soft a brown as the inside of a chestnut burr

exactly chimed in miss riceman i would not be surprised but that i
saw that very girl the other day it was in the managers office she
came alone and she looked well i knew at once that she was a total
stranger to the business and when the manager asked how old she was for
they have to be particular about age you know i think she said
seventeen but i knew she was not quite as old as that

dorothy clasped her hands in a strained gesture how she wanted to find
tavia yet how she feared to discover her in this way

that might be her she faltered thoughtfully

if it was she is with a company playing on the same circuit we do
went on miss riceman let me see and she consulted a slip of paper
pinned to the wall yes they follow us in some towns it was the lady
rossmores secret company that the girl i am speaking about applied to
and im sure she was engaged for i was interested in her appearance and
later i asked some one about her now the thing for you to do is to come
to the managers office here tomorrow afternoon between five and six
he has control of several companies including the one im with and the
l r s as we call it for short the lady rossmores secret i mean
just ask him for your friends address or better still just ask where
the company is playing and shell be sure to be with it he might not pay
much attention to you if he thought you were looking for some one in
particular and hadnt any clue to her whereabouts

ill do it said dorothy determinedly as she arose to go

now dont leave here until you are positive you feel all right
cautioned miss riceman im sure im very glad to have met you and i
hope i have been able to help you im sorry i cant tell you where the
rossmore company is but i havent made a memoranda of the complete
booking as i sometimes do i thought i had it on a slip of paper but i
find i havent

oh im sure youve helped me a lot exclaimed dorothy hardly able to
put her gratitude into words but the busy little actress looked entirely
satisfied with her visitors thanks as she showed dorothy the way out of
the stage door she smiled cheerily at her as she waved her hand in
goodbye and then she went back behind the scenes again to her dressing
room to resume the removal of the makeup from her face




                              chapter xix
                                the clue


outside the door dorothy again felt that girlish inclination to collapse
what excuse could she make to her friends for her delay how would she
get back to them perhaps they were looking all over the city for her and
they might have even notified the police of her absence

all the novelty of the theatre that had for the past half hour put a
world between dorothy and those outside of the stage dressing rooms was
now dispelled what would she say or do when she met rosemary how could
she now conceal her worry and anxiety how was she to continue her search
for tavia

the stage door opened into a dismal narrow alley here dorothy found
herself in the midst of a scurrying crowd of working people for several
large factories had just shut down the girl stood for a moment and
looked helplessly about her presently she felt an arm on her shoulder
and started in alarm

dorothy exclaimed a voice and she turned to see nat standing beside
her

oh nat im so glad

so am i just step along this way i knew you hadnt come out the front
way so i came here

dorothy pressed her shoulder against her cousin in a helpless imploring
sort of way he seemed to know what the action meant for instantly he had
ready to recite a most plausible explanation of her disappearance

you got left behind and were frightened he asked and answered in same
breath i knew it i told em all so then some of the ushers took you
back and let you out of the stage door silly to get alarmed over a
little thing like that but i couldnt talk to mrs markin she was almost
in hysterics wed better hurry back to relieve her suspense

i should not have delayed talking but really i was so so frightened
ventured dorothy

cert you were well you just let me tell the story it will save lots
of trouble but of course the girls will have to know all about the
people you met behind the scenes

was ever there such a blessed boy as nat here he had nicely explained
all dorothys troubles and in the simplest manner possible how splendid
boy cousins are thought dorothy they have such a power of sympathy for
girls better than brothers if girls would only allow them to exercise
it in a cousinly way

or did nat know of dorothys deliberate visit to the little actress who
had played katherine perhaps some one had told him his cousin was in the
dressing room and he had just waited for her to appear at the stage door
dorothy was sure nat would save her from making any troublesome
explanations and when he asked her in the most matteroffact way if
she happened to meet the girl with the brown hair who looked so much like
tavia she had no hesitation in telling him that she was miss riceman
and that she was a most charming young lady

she doesnt look a bit like tavia close by added dorothy remembering
the scene in the dressing room she is as refined and polite as
possible she showed me the way out

after telling that much of her adventure to nat dorothy was well
prepared to repeat the story to the others without fear of disclosing
the real object of her visit behind the scenes

when mrs markin was finally assured of dorothys safety and had
actually listened with interest to her recital of the trip into
stageland and her encounters there the matter was regarded as an
incident fraught with untold curious bits of real live adventure girls
do delight in investigating and exploring the unusual quite as much as
boys do although the latter are prone to attribute that faculty to
themselves as something patented

so it happens that when a girl does actually have an experience she and
her companions know how to appreciate the novelty that was how it turned
out with dorothy and her friends rosemary and alma couldnt hear enough
of behind the scenes and alma ventured to ask dorothy to take them in
through the stage door to make a second call on miss riceman when she
might introduce her friends to a real actress

but dorothy tried to appease their curiosity as best she could telling
over and over again how she got lost in the crowd how the usher accosted
her and led her to the stage and then how she got confused in her
effort to find the right door which was all true enough and how it
was then that miss riceman came out and invited dorothy in then she
related how she became faint and told of the water being brought and so
on until the very closing of the stage door after her when she found
herself in the alley with nat at her side

but now dorothy was about to enter upon a delicate and what might prove
to be a difficult adventure she had to go to the managers office the
next afternoon but beyond that point she dared not trust herself to
think or plan when night came and all seemed to be asleep dorothy in
her room in the big hotel had a chance to look the situation squarely in
the face

one thought i must keep before me she told herself i am bound to
find tavia and save her to do this i will have to take great risks and
perhaps be very much misunderstood but i must do it her risk is even
greater than mine and if i appear to deceive people even dear good
thoughtful nat i must do so to continue my search

then the girl with aching head planned how she could get away to see
the theatrical manager the next day she would not pretend to have any
plans made for going out and then just before the hour miss riceman had
told her the managers office would be open she would announce that she
wanted to get some souvenirs of buffalo to take home with her this she
decided would give her an opportunity to hurry away alone

but oh how she dreaded to face that manager if it were only a woman
who was in charge of the office but a man and she had heard vague
stories of how dreadfully rude some managers were to persons who bothered
them there were so many questions she would have to ask enough to put
any manager into bad humor she thought and perhaps there would be young
girls there like tavia looking for engagements they would overhear what
she had to say oh it was dreadful the more she thought of it

dorothy buried her head deeper into the pillow and tried to sleep she
felt that she must get some rest or she would not be able to carry on the
work that demanded so much of her strength her brains and her courage
she needed them all now to follow up the clue of tavias whereabouts
given by miss riceman

it was almost morning when dorothy fell into an unquiet sleep and it was
glaring daylight with the sun streaming into her window when she awoke
rosemary was moving about the room on tiptoe after some things feeling
the necessity of allowing dorothy all possible rest as she had appeared
so exhausted after her experience of the previous day

im so sorry you are going away tomorrow spoke rosemary seeing that
dorothy was awake this is the last day we will have together for some
time i have enjoyed your visit so much

im afraid ive been rather stupid apologized dorothy feeling as if
she must make some excuse for her seeming indifference to rosemarys
entertainment but cologne dear i can never tell you how grateful i am
for this chance to see buffalo it seems as if i had really entered a new
world since i came into this big city

well im glad you enjoyed everything dear said rosemary but you
must rest today and not go sightseeing any more you will need to be
fresh for your auto trip tomorrow morning

oh yes ill rest today replied dorothy as she slipped into her
dressinggown and approached the dresser there she found a dainty array
of remembrances cologne had selected for her to take home this was a
surprise and it told dorothy more plainly than words could that
rosemary loved her and so loved to make her happy

there were some exquisite bits of undecorated china for dorothy to add to
her collection of handpainted pieces there was a darling little
traveling mirror from mrs markin and jack who would not be left out in
spite of his sisters protestations that a strange young man could not
give a young lady a present even if it was a sort of souvenir of buffalo
had made rosemary place on the table with the other tokens a cute little
pocket camera he secretly hoped his sister would just hint to dorothy
that he had selected it

such an array quite overpowered dorothy and she threw her arms about
rosemarys neck and cried as if her heart would break

she calmed down after a while but even when she and rosemary were
dressed the two had little spells of weeping at the thought of parting
jack peeped in at the door but when he saw his sister and dorothy in an
embrace with tears in their eyes he hurried away muttering something
about fool girls crying when theyre happy and he guessed he wouldnt
hang around to spoil their fun if that was what they called a merry
time

so the two girls were left to themselves to exchange confidences and talk
over their fall meeting at glenwood when school should begin again

time managed to slip around quickly that day and when afternoon came
dorothy began to get nervous about her prospective visit to the managers
office it would surely seem rude to leave rosemary alone but nothing
must deter her from carrying out her plan no not even the displeasure of
her friends and this was no small matter to dorothy when she faced
it she who made such firm friendships when she did make them and who was
always an example of good breeding and politeness

when her valise had been packed so that the entire evening might be left
for pleasure and nat and ned had appeared from their quarters to make
final arrangements about coming for dorothy directly after breakfast she
glanced at her watch and found it lacked just half an hour of five
oclock the boys were engaged in an argument with rosemary as to the
relative beauty of boston and new york ned holding that a battery and a
bowery made new york the winner

suddenly dorothy jumped up from the porch chair where she had been
sitting

i believe ill just run down town to get some more souvenir postal
cards she said bravely as she started to leave the veranda she had
her purse in her hand and there was no need to wear a hat

why asked cologne in natural surprise i thought you had plenty

nat saw the flush of color that came into dorothys cheeks

and im with you he declared getting up from his place and assisting
his cousin down the steps so long he called back do the best you
can ned ill be back directly just want to make sure that doro doesnt
fall by the wayside again and at that the two cousins bolted off
laughing dorothy having recovered her composure when she saw how quickly
nat came to her relief ned and rosemary were taken so by surprise at
the sudden move that they seemed dazed and the look on their faces at
the bolt of the two only made the departing ones more merry

nat said dorothy as they turned the corner i really wanted to go to
some place 

go ahead then he answered only doro you know ned and i are
responsible for you and you had best tell me about it you know i wont
interfere only to be sure its all right

nat you are such a good cousin began dorothy

good echoed nat why you dont say so make a note of that and tell
the others they would never believe me there did you see that streak of
sunshine stick to my brow it was a halo sure thing but i say what
are you going to do anyhow

to look for tavia replied dorothy miserably

thought so but where is the looking to be done this time

i thought i would inquire at the office of the theatre they might
happen to know something

all right come along ill wait outside theatre people especially
managers and those in the office are usually very busy and wont keep
you long

this was said with all possible kindness but somehow it gave dorothy a
cold chill she was so afraid of facing the manager oh if she only
could let nat go in with her but that would not be fair to tavia whose
secret if she ever discovered it she determined to keep inviolate she
must do it alone and do it secretly to save tavia from the possible
consequences of her folly should it turn out that she really was with a
company on the road

one more block and nat and dorothy were in front of the theatre where
they had attended the play the day before they stood before the great
open lobby empty now save for a few workmen who were busy with mops
scrubbing the tiled marble floor nat took dorothys arm

theres the office of the manager right over there he said
indicating a small door that bore no mark to distinguish it from many
others that opened from the foyer ill wait here for you now dont be
afraid to push yourself up front if theres a crowd waiting for him we
havent any too much time

with all the courage that dorothy could summon to her aid she walked up
to the little door opened it and stepped inside a little anteroom she
was in the managers office and the presence of several other persons
who turned to stare at her did not serve to put her at her ease




                               chapter xx
                        dorothy and the manager


dorothy sank into a chair near the door two or three importantlooking
women were moving about restlessly awaiting their turn to pass beyond
the portal guarded by a stout youth and face the manager in his private
rooms others younger and more timid sat quite still in their chairs
as did dorothy and the girl could imagine that they were silently
praying for success in the prospective interview with one who might
decide their fate dorothy seemed beyond thinking consistently about her
own circumstances she just sat there and waited the youth at the door
of the private office looked at her sharply doubtless he was wondering
whether she had an appointment or whether she was one to be allowed to
enter out of her turn because of some pull

it seemed to dorothy that the very place rang with an appeal for place
for position for opportunity although not a word was spoken but the
look on the faces of those waiting spoke louder than words

finally a girl in a red hat went in and came out so quickly that the
others looked at her curiously she murmured something that showed she
had been treated with scant ceremony then a very stout woman wearing an
enormous veil brushed past dorothy she was not escorted in by the boy
but dashed past him as the girl in red came out then when the woman
with the excess of avoirdupois came out the boy stepped up to dorothy

your turn he said kindly then it occurred to dorothy that every one
so far had been kind to her were these people that others had spoken of
so slightingly not all respectful and polite to any one who seemed to
merit such consideration she felt that they were not half as black as
they had been painted

the next moment the anxious girl was in the private office of the
manager it was a small room but not gloomy in spite of the fact that it
was in the midst of a darkened theatre a fine rug was on the floor and
there were a few wellchosen pictures on the walls the electric lights
showing them off to advantage

while the manager who sat in a big revolving chair looked over some
papers on his desk before turning to dorothy she had an opportunity to
see that there hung before him what were evidently family photographs
one was of a little girl and another of a youth surely she thought a
man who had time to look at his childrens pictures during business hours
could not be so very harsh because his time was taken up by a girl

well asked the manager suddenly as he wheeled around in his chair
wiping his glasses carefully but not seeming to look at dorothy

she caught her breath with a gasp the moment had come her heart was
beating painfully

i i came to to ask if you if you have on your books the name of a young
lady miss octavia travers she managed to stammer out a young lady
with the lady rossmores secret company i believe

travers repeated the manager thoughtfully travers seems to me i
have is she your sister

not exactly but i have always regarded her as such we have been very
close friends all our lives

not a very long time at that remarked the manager with a smile but
what is it you want to know about her

to get her address

let me see ill look it up but if she is such a close friend of yours
why didnt she send you her address she knew where she was going to be
and he spoke pointedly

tears welled into dorothys eyes and she felt that she could not trust
herself to speak the manager looked critically at her then he laid
aside the book he had picked up to consult

run away he asked

dorothy nodded

well dont feel so badly about it my girl well see if we cant find
her for you but first you had better tell me the story it will help
greatly you see when we engage a girl and she happens to prove
satisfactory we have no excuse for dismissing her unless she might be
under age and then her parents of course 

but i must keep the entire matter from her parents interrupted
dorothy i must find tavia myself and i know when i do she will listen
to me and it will be all right again

dorothy was visibly trembling the manager folded his arms and looked at
her thoughtfully

youre quite a young girl to undertake this he said finally but i
like your spirit and im going to help you i tell you my child the
stage is no place for a young person who has had no experience with the
ways of the world i never encourage a young girl to go on the stage
there are plenty of older characters whom we can get and then there is
less danger but this girl you are looking for was she about your
height

yes with very brown hair replied dorothy and such lovely light
brown eyes

let me see and he consulted the book again dorothy waited anxiously
as he turned page after page then he stopped yes here it is he
said christina travers that must be the girl they rarely give the
name just right

yes she might say christina admitted dorothy the girls at school
called her chris for short

well she is with the l r s company i beg your pardon i mean the
lady rossmores secret company we get in the habit of abbreviating it
its a light thing we put on for a filler im afraid it isnt doing any
too well which however may make it easier for you to induce your
friend to give it up

oh i hope i can and dorothy left her seat and came to stand beside
the managers desk she had lost nearly all her fear and nervousness now

they play in rochester tonight went on the manager consulting his
list then they go to rockdale 

only one night in rochester asked dorothy showing some surprise and
disappointment

well one night of that i fancy will be enough for any place was the
managers laughing reply however they may stay over tomorrow but
rockdale is only a few miles from there you could easily catch them at
rockdale is there anything more i can do for you

no thank you and dorothy turned away

if i can now or later just let me know went on the manager then he
wished her goodbye and turned back to his desk

dorothys cheeks were flushed when she stepped up to nat in the lobby
where he was watching the men putting in place the photographs of the
next weeks performers he seemed to have forgotten all about his cousin

oh is that you he asked and he looked like some one suddenly
awakened from a dream i do believe if i stood here much longer id be
put into a frame by mistake how did you make out

you mustnt ask answered dorothy pleasantly you see i cant quite
report on it yet

oh very well i was only wondering 

but you mustnt wonder you agreed to act as my escort and so you must
be content with that i can only tell you that i am perfectly satisfied
with the interview i had

which means that our little friend tavia is not with any company well
im glad of it i always did give her credit for having better sense but
you see doro you are such a romancer that you sometimes make stories
out of dreams but i must say you do look ten years younger that manager
must have been a nice fellow

he was answered dorothy glad that nat as usual had jumped to a
conclusion and decided the matter of the interview for himself leaving
her free to go on without contradicting or making any explanations it
was so much better under the circumstances she thought that not even
nat should know the truth

but just how she was going to carry out the remainder of her task
secretly she could not quite determine however she had now become
accustomed to doing each part as it presented itself without planning
further into the future and in that manner she hoped to be able to
proceed until the last link in the chain of her search had been
completed

we must get the souvenir cards nat reminded her as they came to a
store with the prettypictured varieties in the window ill just buy a
pack of mixed ones it will save time

but dorothy was not thinking of souvenir cards thoughts came to her of
the play at rochester with tavia as one of the characters tavia who must
be timid amid her new and unaccustomed surroundings in spite of her
apparent recklessness yes tavia would be much frightened at what she had
done dorothy was sure of it when the girl so far away from home and
friends found herself before a critical audience in a theatre

if i could only reach her before another night dorothy thought but
how can it be managed

the boys would start for home tomorrow and of course dorothy would have
to go with them something would surely happen must surely happen
before then to help her dorothy thought with a confidence which great
emergencies sometimes inspire

now i suppose remarked nat as he made his way out of the postcard
store if you were to send one of these particularly bright red ones to
tavia at dalton she would send one back on the next mail wishing you a
merry christmas for all your trouble what do you suppose she would say
if she knew of the merry chase that had been going on after her and all
the places you have been looking for her and all the while she was as
safe as little bopeep

but i dont intend to send her any cards until she writes me first
answered dorothy she owes me an apology for not writing to me

same here said nat ill treat her the same way the saucy little
thing he added facetiously not to answer our nice long letters she
ought to be slapped

dorothy laughed at her cousins good humor it was better that he should
take this view of the case than that he should suspect the real facts
dorothy glanced at some of the cards as they hurried along back to the
hotel

now theres one pointed out nat that would just suit the
circumstances a girl doing a song and a smile thats the turn tavia
has been doing to you doro we must save that one for her

yes answered dorothy abstractedly taking the card in her hand it was
the picture of a girl in chorus costume and was enscribed with an
appropriate verse

dont you see explained nat theyve got everything down to a
postcard basis now that one is intended to be used in place of making a
party call when a gentleman has blown a girl to a theatrical good time
she just sends this card back and that suffices for formal thanks

of course it might not just suit our set he conceded but for those
in the postcard clientele its a cinch as the poet says i tell you
after a while we will be able to carry on all our business correspondence
with picture postals and not be under the necessity of writing a word
great scheme nat patting himself on the left shoulder with his right
hand get a patent on your new postcard

they had now reached the hotel the veranda was deserted as the hour for
dinner was almost at hand and the guests were dressing nat left dorothy
at the elevator with a warning to be ready early in the morning then he
hurried to where he and ned were staying




                              chapter xxi
                        adrift in a strange city


in spite of dorothys courage and her efforts to keep each of her
troubles apart that she might meet and cope with them singly the time
had now come when she found herself sorely puzzled

how would she be able to reach rochester to leave her cousins and proceed
alone in her search for tavia

the morning of departure dawned bright and clear conditions most
necessary for a pleasant automobile trip and when the markin family
waved an affectionate adieu the fire bird puffed away from in front of
the hotel rosemary throwing innumerable kisses to dorothy suddenly as
they swung into the street dorothy turned to ned and asked

ned could you let me go part of the way home by train i did not want
to mention it at the hotel as mrs markin would be sure to worry but i
would so like to return by rail you could just leave me at the depot and
then you might stop for me at did you say you were going through
rochester on your way back

ned and nat gazed at their cousin in surprise what could she mean to ask
to leave them and go to north birchland alone

i know you think it strange she hastened to add but really you know
i am able to travel alone that short distance you know i came from
glenwood alone

oh yes i know replied nat but this time mother put you in our
charge and these are big cities around here

but if the auto makes you feel ill put in nat of course no one could
object to you going by train

i would so much rather declared dorothy taking advantage of nats
ready excuse for her i have found that there is a train at
eightthirty then if you pass through rochester you could meet me
there i can go to some young womens club and wait if i do not meet you
exactly on time at the station

this was a brave stroke and dorothy felt that she would not be equal to
further argument should the boys offer much more opposition

you mean for us to leave you here at the buffalo depot asked ned in a
dazed sort of way

yes i have plenty of money with me and i know perfectly well how to
travel alone

but you may have to change cars and suppose you were to be left alone
in rochester in case we had a breakdown and couldnt pick you up

it wouldnt be any worse staying in rochester than it would in some
place near where you happened to have the accident i hope you dont have
any but i have told you what i would do in case you didnt call for me
id stay at some girls club there are plenty of them in rochester ive
read

well admitted ned i suppose you ought to know what you want to do

theres the station exclaimed nat what time did you say the train
left

eightthirty replied dorothy we have plenty of time

but when she realized that she was to be left alone to go in a train to
that strange big city she felt as if she must cry out against the
circumstances that forced her to all this trouble why should she deceive
her two kind cousins and desert them to take that risky journey alone
and she did believe her prospective trip dangerous in spite of her
assertions to the contrary it was very different to making the journey
to glenwood when she had had tavia with her

besides going into the new england mountains was along a quiet way
while this trip she dared not trust herself to think further she must
decide at once and she must go alone to look for tavia

ill get you a pullman ticket ned said rather gloomily as the auto
dashed up to the station but i do wish doro that you would come on
with us of course in the parlor car you will be quite safe and can
rest better than in the fire bird ill see the porter and have him look
after you

thank you ned dorothy managed to reply and but for his haste to
make arrangements for her comfort the youth would have seen tears in his
cousins eyes and noticed that her hands trembled as nat helped her out
of the machine to the station platform

i think after all it will be better for you to go straight on to north
birchland she said trying to make her voice sound easy and natural
but conscious that her tones were rather unsteady she was now putting
into operation the second part of her plan it might be risky to attempt
to pick me up in rochester i might miss you or you might miss me
whereas if we both follow out our route separately we will be sure to get
to the cedars in safety and without any delay

well since you have decided to desert us and travel by train leaving
the poor old fire bird to struggle along as best it can without a lady
passenger perhaps it will be best nat agreed in a dazed sort of way
he seemed for a time quite unlike nat white quite different from the
youth who was always ready to take up the weak end of an argument and
carry it to the strongest point of conclusion here he was letting his
favorite cousin start away alone on a train to a strange big city when
she had been entrusted to his care

here you are doro called ned coming from the depot where he had
hurried as soon as the auto stopped take this and he thrust some
bills into her hands as well as her tickets and do above everything
else be careful ive seen the porter and tipped him so he will look
after you now youd better get in and well leave you as we want to
make good time goodbye and he stooped to kiss the palefaced girl who
was now too overcome with emotion to trust her own voice

nat put his arm affectionately around her and he too gave her a
farewell kiss they walked with her to the waiting train and then the
porter in his blue uniform adorned with numerous brass buttons helped
her aboard the car seneca




                              chapter xxii
                            in dire distress


dorothy had traveled in parlor cars before but had never ridden in a
sleeper which was the style of coach she now found herself in the train
was a through one from the west and as the regular parlor cars were full
ned had to get a ticket in the sleeper which by day is much the same as
a parlor car

as the porter set her valise down and arranged a seat for her near the
ladies retiring room dorothys heart beat fast and though the
surroundings were new and novel to her she took no interest in them but
as the train whistled off and the other passengers began moving about
dorothy lifted her head and glanced around

for a moment she felt that some mistake had been made surely this was no
train for ladies for not a woman was in sight instead the entire car
seemed filled with men in various stages of incomplete toilets some were
adjusting their neckties as they walked through the aisle others were
fastening shoe laces and a few buckling their belts or slipping on their
coats

then she noticed for the first time that the car was a sleeper for the
interior was so dark because of the train shed when she entered that she
could not tell what it was she saw the berths on both sides with heavy
curtains lining the aisle only one or two beds had been shut up and
turned into seats like the one she was occupying

dorothy was annoyed was she to make her lonely trip in company with a
car full of men she had expected when she planned her journey that
there would be other girls and ladies in the coach in which she was to
travel and that she might appeal to them in case of need but a whole
car full of men

she looked about for the little electric call button and finding it in
the casement at the side of the window pressed it vigorously it was
some time before the porter responded as all along his route the
omnipresent men claimed his attention for various services but finally
he reached the end of the car where the girl in the blue sailor suit sat
up very prim and stiff waiting for him

is this er a ladies car she asked timidly

a ladies car oh yes miss this is all right this is the car for
rochester

but i never was in a car like like this before dorothy objected
glancing about at the men who were still struggling in the aisles with
various refractory articles of clothing

for a moment the porter seemed puzzled then all at once he understood
dorothys objection

oh thems only the gentlemen gettin ready to leave miss theyll all
be out soon and youll have more room anything i can do for you miss

no and dorothy just checked herself from adding thank you which she
felt would not be quite proper and would show that she was unused to the
attention of a porter then the colored attendant made his way down the
aisle while the only girl in the car held her face close against the
window pane and fell to thinking of the task that lay before her

she was not now troubled about the car and the occupants if it was all
right and she would be brought safely to rochester in it that was all
she had to consider of course it would have been less lonely to have had
the usual day coach passengers with her but she thought ned must have
selected this car and she felt he knew best then too the porter had
said the men were rapidly leaving their berths and as soon as they did so
the colored man made the folding beds into broad velvet seats similar to
the one occupied by dorothy

when these seats had replaced the hanging curtains and the comfortable
places were occupied by the men who had been so lately sleeping even
though there were no women among them dorothy recovered from her first
shock of embarrassment the passengers all appeared to be gentlemen and
not one of them seemed to even glance in her direction though they must
have realized how strange it was for a pretty girl to be the lone female
passenger

when the spasm of brushing clothes into which the porter threw himself
was finally over which operation dorothy could not help watching for it
was done with such dispatch and when the men had gone to the dining car
for breakfast or become engrossed in their newspapers she tried to map
out her days programme

i will get off at rochester she told herself and then ill inquire
for the criterion theatre she looked at the slip of paper which she
carried so carefully in the little brown leather wrist bag then she
went on if the company has left rochester i will go to rockdale but if
it should get dark she cried in a low wail of terror if it should get
dark and i should be all alone in a strange city

then came the thought of the folks at home and how they would worry if
night came on and she did not reach them was ever a girl so situated

all sorts of dangers flashed before her mind and now though too late
she realized sharply how unfit a young girl is to cope with a big
strange world how little the world cares for a girls tender feelings
and how cold and heartless it is when she tries to make her way through
the city streets alone yet crowded on every side by a throng of other
human beings

but tavia had to go through it concluded dorothy and i must not be
less brave than was she

the train was somewhat delayed on the run from buffalo to rochester so
it was almost noon when dorothy reached the latter city

on a slip of paper she had the directions of the theatre she wished to
visit and at the ticket station learned where the building was located
then off she started with never a look at the shop windows filled with
wonderful displays of all kinds she soon found the amusement resort and
stepping into the lobby approached the ticket window and asked timidly

can you tell me where the lady rossmores secret company is playing
tonight

the man looked at her sharply then he smiled so ironically that
dorothys heart gave a painful thump and a great lump came into her
throat

lady rossmores secret company he repeated with the most prolonged
and distracting drawl i guess there isnt any its down and out
didnt play to a house here last night big enough to pay the gas bills

but the members of the company asked dorothy with a choke in her
voice

hum how should i know he asked with a sneer in jail maybe for not
paying their board bills

for a moment dorothy felt that she must cry out and tell him that the
matter was very vital to her that she must find a young and friendless
girl who was a member of the company but she realized what sort of a man
he was and her better judgment asserted itself

but are there any members of the company in this city she persisted
bravely trying to keep up her courage so as to get a clue as to the
whereabouts of tavia

in this city he repeated with the same distracting drawl well no
they managed to get out of here before the sheriff could attach their
baggage and the scenery which he was ready to do they certainly were as
poor a company as we ever had in this theatre it was awful oh no they
didnt dare stay here

then where did they go

rockdale was their next booked place but maybe they didnt dare go
there for fear some word had been sent on ahead the ticket seller
sneered

how can i get to rockdale asked the girl trying to keep back her
tears

get there on a train of course and the man turned back to the paper
he had been reading when dorothy came in perhaps he was angry because
she had not purchased a ticket to the current attraction

if you would be be kind enough to direct me pleaded dorothy i am a
stranger here and i must find a a young girl who is with that company

something in her voice and manner seemed to touch the rather indifferent
man for he straightened up in his tall chair and looked squarely and
more kindly at dorothy

oh thats it is it i didnt know i have a lot of silly girls always
asking about traveling companies after theyve left here and i thought
you might be one of them now youre talking yes of course certainly
if youve got to find anybody connected with that company youd better be
quick about it for i should think there wouldnt be much left of em by
this time i heard they had quite a time of it getting their trunks away
from here held up for board you know but of course theyre used to
that sort of thing

dorothy took hold of the brass rail in front of her as she turned away
from the window she felt as if she could hardly stand any more of the
mans veiled insinuations but it might not be true surely it could not
be true it was only his cruel teasing way tavia could not be in such
distress

how can i get there dorothy repeated

if you want to get to rockdale the ticket seller answered after a
pause you can take the train at twelve fortyfive

thank you murmured dorothy turning dizzily toward the street to make
her way to the station she had so recently left how she managed to reach
the place she never knew the great buildings along the way seemed about
to topple over on her head her temples were throbbing and her eyes shot
out streaks of flashing light her knees trembled under her if only she
had time to get something to eat but she must not miss that train it
might be the last one that day

through the crowd of waiting persons she made her way to the ticket
office and purchased the slip of cardboard that entitled her to a ride
she learned that the train was late and that she would have to wait ten
minutes grateful for that respite dorothy turned to the little lunch
counter to get a sandwich and some coffee but before she had reached
the end of the big depot where refreshments were sold she suddenly
stopped some one had grabbed her skirt

turning quickly dorothy beheld a crouching cringing figure almost
crawling so as to hide herself in the crowd

girl cried dorothy trying to shake off the grasp on her skirt let
me go what do you want

dont you know me whispered the miserable creature look again dont
you know urania the gypsy girl

then beneath the rags and the appearance of age that seemed in so short
a time to have hidden the identity of this young girl dorothy did
recognize urania how wretched how forlorn she was and even in danger of
arrest if she was seen begging in the depot

dont turn away from me miss pleaded the unfortunate gypsy girl
please help me

she stretched out to dorothy a dirty trembling hand the gate to the
rockdale train had been thrown open and dorothy felt that the time was
almost up

you should go home she said dropping a coin into the outstretched
palm

yes yes i want to go home cried the girl and dorothy was afraid her
voice would attract attention in the crowd but the passengers were too
busy rushing for their trains to heed anything else i want to go home
pleaded urania you should take me home it was your fine cousin the boy
with the taffycolored hair that brought me here

what cried dorothy how dare you say such a thing

ask him then if it isnt so and ask him if he wasnt in this very
station an hour ago looking for some one that redheaded girl likely

do you mean to say you saw my cousin here today gasped dorothy
come tell me the truth and you shall go home ill take you home
myself only tell me the truth

yes ill do it answered the girl well him and his brother came in
here an hour ago they asked the man at the window if he had seen a young
girl with a brown hand bag i stood near to listen but kept out of
sight then they dashed off again before i could ask them for a penny or
throw it up to that dandy that it was the ride he gave me in the auto
that brought me to this

dont talk so exclaimed dorothy much shocked do you want to go back
to the camp where your people are she was too dumfounded at the news to
argue with the wild creature

yes oh yes back to the camp and uranias eyes flashed theyll
take me back even melea would not turn me out now for i am sick and
sorrowful

it needed but a glance to see that in this at least the girl spoke
truthfully

come ordered dorothy ill take care of you but first i must get
something to eat we have a few minutes

without heeding the attention she attracted by almost dragging the beggar
girl up to the lunch counter dorothy made her way there and ordered
coffee and sandwiches for both she hurriedly disposed of her own share
being only a little behind urania who ate as though famished then
hastily procuring another ticket she bolted through the door followed
by the gypsy who seemed to take it all as a matter of course

the ride was for the most part a silent one dorothy was busy with her
thoughts and the gypsy girl was almost afraid to speak

but you will see me to my home to the camp she pleaded once

yes answered dorothy but you must have patience i have something
more important to attend to first

i can wait answered the little gypsy

the rockdale station was a brick structure with a modest waitingroom
for women passengers at the far end it was there that dorothy took
urania as they left the train which steamed away into the distance the
room was without a single occupant a matter of rejoicing to dorothy as
she had already experienced considerable difficulty in passing with
urania through the ordinary marts of travel

now you stay here she told the gypsy girl and ill go out and get
you something you must be sure to stay in this corner and eat carefully
so as not to make crumbs if the station agent should speak to you while
im gone just tell him you are waiting for for a lady who told you not
to leave this room until she returned

willingly enough urania sank down on a corner of the bench and tried to
smile her thanks at dorothy but dorothy was too excited to notice the
feeble effort she hurried to a little store opposite the station bought
some crackers and cakes and after putting the package into the gypsys
hands with another word of caution was off again this time to find the
lyceum theatre

it seemed to dorothy that any place must be easy to find in a small town
and when she was directed to the theatre by a man on the street she was
not surprised to find that it was but a few blocks from the depot

hurrying along she reached a big hall for the lyceum in spite of its
name was nothing but a big country hall with the additional attraction
of iron fire escapes she knocked at the big broad wooden door but soon
discovered that the place was locked up and evidently deserted she
made a number of inquiries of boys she saw nearby but all the
information she could elicit from the urchins amounted to nothing more
than laughter and guying to the effect that the company had come to
grief in its attempt to give rockdale folks a hint as to what lady
rossmores secret was it appeared that the company had arrived in
town but had at once gotten into legal difficulties because of some
trouble back in rochester

but where are the members of the company dorothy asked of one boy who
was larger than his companions and who had not been so ready to make fun
of the unfortunates

somes gone back home i guess that is if they has homes somes hanging
round the hotel where their trunks was attached as soon as the baggage
man brought em in somes sitting around on the benches in the green
guess none of em had any dinner today for them hotel people is as mean
as dirt

where is the hotel

thats the hotel over there answered the boy pointing to a building
on the opposite corner mansion house they call it though i never
could see much of a mansion about that old barn

the afternoon was wearing away and dorothy felt that she must make all
possible haste if she was to get back to north birchland that night as
she knew she must for her own sake so thanking the boy she hurried over
to the hotel and after making some inquiries of a number of loungers on
the broad low veranda was directed to the office

she asked some questions regarding the whereabouts of members of the
theatrical company but the man at the dingy old desk was inclined to
make inquiries himself rather than answer dorothys he wanted to know
if she had called to settle up for any of the guys and if not he
demanded to know if she took him for a bureau of information or a public
phonograph and he grinned delightfully at his feeble wit

i dont keep tabs on every barnstorming theatrical company he growled
out much as i kin do to look after their baggage and see they dont
skin me thats my game in a case like this

dorothy pleaded with him to give her any information he might have as to
the whereabouts of any girl or woman member of the company but he was
ugly evidently because of the loss of some money or patronage in
connection with the theatrical fiasco and would not give so much as an
encouraging word

dorothy looked about but could see no one who seemed to be an actor or
actress she had learned in a measure to know the type fairly sick and
disheartened she turned away how could she give up now when she felt
that tavia must be almost within hearing of her voice how loudly her
heart cried out surely some kind fate would bear that cry to tavias ear
and bring her to her friend dorothy for now dorothy felt that she could
hardly go many steps farther in her weary search

she heard a train steam into the station and go on without making a stop

oh thought dorothy if we could only get a train back again soon but
i can not give her up i must must find her wherever she is

exhausted and discouraged she sank down by the roadside at a grassy spot
where the street turned into a country park she felt that she must
cry she would feel better when she had cried out there alone away from
the cruel persons away from the seemingly cruel fate that was so
relentlessly urging her on beyond her strength beyond the actual power of
human endurance was there ever so wretched a girl as was dorothy dale at
that moment yes she would indulge in a good cry she knew it would
relieve her nerves and then she could go on

the rough boys playing nearby saw the girl sitting beside the road and
whether out of kindness or curiosity they hastened over to the place and
stood looking down at dorothy in respectful silence

did they do anyting to youse asked a little fellow with a ring of
vengeance in his small shrill voice dem hotel guys is too fresh an
me fader is goin hes goin t do someting to dem if dey dont look
out

dats right spoke up another his fader is de sheriff an hes goin
t rest em if dey dont pay der own bills fer all der talk of holdin
de show trunks

dorothy raised her head surely these boys were trying to comfort her in
their own rough but earnest way perhaps they could help her look for
tavia

do any of you know where the girls of this company are now she asked
of the boys collectively i am searching for a girl with brown hair 

she stopped abruptly realizing how useless it would be to give these
boys a description of tavia

i sawr a girl wit a big kind of a hat and a little satchel an i know
she was wit de show volunteered a redhaired urchin i was right
alongside of her when she bought five cents wort of cakes at rooneys
an after dat i seen her sittin on a bench in de green

honest asked an older boy severely turning to the one who had given
the information no kiddin now signal or well blow out your red
light this reference being to the boys brilliant hair we want t
help dis gurl t find de young lady dont we fellers

sure came in a ready chorus

i did see her protested signal rubbing his hand over his fiery locks
and rumpling them up until they looked like a brush heap ablaze i sawr
her less n hour ago

where asked dorothy eagerly

on a bench in de green and the lad pointed out the direction to
dorothy

she followed the road to the end and there stretching out before her was
an open common or the green as the boys called it in the centre was a
little park where a pretty fountain sent a spray of sparkling water high
into the air arranged about it were benches under shady bowers formed
by overhanging bushes and there were clumps of shrubbery that separated
the seats and concealed them

dorothy walked straight to the fountain she sank down on a bench where
she could watch the spurting water and listen to the cool tinkle as it
fell into the basin the sun shone through the spray making a small
rainbow

it looked like a sign of hope but she was too discouraged and dispirited
to place much faith in it she wanted to see tavia yet where was she
here was the park the boys had spoken of but there was no sign of the
missing girl

dorothy felt she could not stay there long after a few minutes rest she
arose to make a circuit of the little park hoping she might have
overlooked some spot where tavia might be as she crossed back of a clump
of shrubbery she saw the skirt of a girls dress showing on the border of
a little side path it riveted her attention she turned down the path

there sat a girl a most forlorn looking girl her head buried in her arms
that rested on the back of a bench dorothy could see her shoulders
heaving under the stress of heavy sobs

she started she held her breath it looked like yet could it be her was
it she feared to ask herself the question

the girl on the bench raised her tearstained face she looked full at
dorothy

tavia screamed dorothy springing forward

dorothy echoed tavia

there was a rush and the next instant dorothy dale held tavia clasped
close in her arms while she murmured over and over again

tavia dear tavia i have found you at last oh i am so glad

tavia could only sob




                             chapter xxiii
                         the secret conclusion


it was some moments before either girl was able to speak after that first
burst of emotion and surprise but dorothy was too happy to remain long
in tears even tears of joy that for the moment had overcome her

tavia was pale and her eyes were red from much weeping her unhappy
plight was apparent at a glance and this was incentive enough to cause
dorothy to again clasp her in her arms and hug her tighter than ever she
had forgotten her own physical weakness now that she had found tavia and
she felt that she must hasten to get her dear friend into a state of mind
that might help her to forget the sad experiences she had passed through

tavia tavia dear whispered dorothy as the girl fell again to
weeping do look up and forget it all for my sake do i have searched
so long for you but now i have found you come with me and well be just
the same as we always were

oh how can i cried the miserable girl who will look at me now how
can i ever face the folks again oh dorothy let me go away forever i
can not bear the disgrace and she moaned pitifully in her bitter
anguish

but tavia you really meant nothing wrong said dorothy taking the
trembling hands in her own which were scarcely less agitated

no i never meant to do wrong spoke tavia lifting her head with her
old proud bearing i broke my promise to you i listened to that girl in
rochester she gave me a letter to a theatrical manager in buffalo i only
wanted to make a name for myself to gratify my ambition i wanted to earn
money to get back to school you know we had no more 

you poor darling whispered dorothy was that it dont worry so no
one will ever know i have not told even nat and we will keep it a
secret between us forever do come with me dear as tavia appeared to
look brighter i must get to north birchland tonight oh if you ever
knew the time i had getting away from the boys and she went on
hurriedly for several minutes

and did you come all the way alone dorothy dale you have saved me in
spite of myself declared tavia almost tragically yes i will go
back i can look them all in the face for i only tried to work and i did
not mean to deceive any one longer than would be necessary for me to get
a start but now dorothy i have had enough of it where do you want me
to go

so it wasnt as nice as you thought it would be asked dorothy anxious
to hear some of tavias experiences

nice there was no concealing the disgust in tavias voice it was
awful dorothy it was a regular barnstorming company playing onenight
stands we never had good houses they said it was because it was the
summer season but i guess it was because the play was so poor we did
not get all our salaries and half the time didnt have enough to eat
then the show busted

did you have a good part i believe they call it

a good part say doro and tavia actually seemed her old self again
i had an idea i was to be lady rossmore or at least one of the family

werent you

i should say not i was lucy the parlor maid and the only time i was
on the stage was when i was dusting the makebelieve furniture and as
for my lines well i had a very heavy and strong thinking part

oh tavia

thats my theatrical experience answered tavia oh doro im very
miserable she wailed again

never mind dear dry your eyes now youre all right im oh im so
happy that i have found you again come back to the station with me i
have some one else to bring home too urania the gypsy girl you
remember her at glenwood i guess she has been trying to see the world
and she caught too big a glimpse of it poor girl she is quite sick and
miserable

then as they hurried from the park dorothy told tavia of the trouble
she had to get urania on the train a happy thought came to tavia and
with a bright smile she said

i have it in this little hand bag all the baggage i have left by the
way i have a very quiet suit i used it in the play for sometimes i had
to take two or three parts if one of the other girls was ill but they
never amounted to much the parts i mean we can put this suit on urania

being thus able to help some one else worse off than herself seemed to do
tavia good for her kind heart always prompted her to acts of this sort
it was a step back into the old life

at the station they found urania all excitement

the young men were here she exclaimed to dorothy and they have gone
off to look for you i didnt dare speak to them but i peeked out and i
heard the station man tell them where he had seen you go to and they
flew off again in their dustwagon like mad oh miss i wish they had
found you and they looked so tired and hardly spoke like ive always
heard em so polite and nice

ned and nat here in rockdale exclaimed dorothy overjoyed at the news
here urania you go in that little room and put these things on youll
find in this bag and she handed the gypsy tavias little valise

ill help her volunteered tavia glad to be of service to dorothy

now remember tavia said dorothy in a low tone whoever we meet now
im to do all the talking this is my big secret and you must let me take
care of it have you any baggage oh i forgot all the baggage of the
company is held for debts i believe

not mine replied tavia promptly all i have is in my valise it was
so small they let me keep it they only wanted trunks and i didnt have
any i travel light

well hurry now and get urania ready said dorothy she walked over
toward the door of the ladies waiting room suddenly she fancied she
heard yes sure enough that was the toot of the fire birds horn

oh tavia she called here they come hurry hurry urania tavia we
must all be out there together when they come up

at that the automobile swept up to the station in a cloud of dust out on
the platform hurried dorothy tavia and urania the latter smiling
broadly in her new outfit

well i give up exclaimed nat the first to alight from the panting
car if you havent given us a merry chase dorothy we got worried
after you left us and we traced you from place to place thought sure
wed lost you here oh it was a merry chase

glad it was merry exclaimed tavia forgetting that dorothy was to do
all the talking

yes i should say it was put in ned and she skipped off to meet you
without giving us a hint 

now ned dont be cross said dorothy sweetly see what a large party
you have to take home and you must not scold the girls for we have as
much right as you boys have to take little trips together

the boys were too well pleased to argue or be angry in fact they had
had a very miserable time of it since dorothy escaped as they called
it now they wanted nothing better than to get into the machine with the
girls and make all speed for home

have you room for urania asked dorothy can she stand up between the
seats

why of course assented ned plenty of room get aboard everybody

let me get under the seat protested the gypsy girl that was the way
i came out

so it was said nat id almost forgotten about you young lady shes
the girl he went on turning to the others who stole a ride with me
the day i went into dalton dorothy she actually rode under the back
seat where shed hidden in the night she made the noise we thought was a
burglar you know she gave me the slip though when i went to take her
back so now she must ride in the open where i can keep my eye on her

oh urania you said  began dorothy thinking of what the gypsy girl
had said about nat taking her away

oh please dont be hard on me pleaded urania i was so miserable i
didnt know what i was saying its true just as he says and its all
my fault i ran away he didnt take me

dorothy climbed in beside ned tavia was in her usual seat with nat then
urania squatted down in true gypsy fashion on the floor of the car at
their feet

i guess well just about make it after all commented ned as he turned
on the power more fully and threw in the clutch were due home about
seven but well have to speed it up a bit to do it lucky its nearly
level all the way

and when we do get home put in nat you girls will just have to own
up and tell the whole story no serial for ours we want it complete in
one number

indeed well do nothing of the sort exclaimed dorothy were not
going to tell you a single word well get home about on time according
to agreement and you have no reason to find a single bit of fault tavia
will come to north birchland just as she promised to early in the season
shes been too busy to come before and dorothy smiled and if we do
have our own affairs to talk about you must not expect to know
everything girls have to have secrets or they wouldnt be girls and we
have now got ours

yes agreed tavia in a low voice with a loving look at her chum its
dorothys great secret and i guess ill help her keep it

and here as they are speeding toward north birchland we will take leave
of dorothy tavia and the boys for a while dorothy kept the secret as
did tavia and no one ever knew the real meaning of tavias absence nor
why dorothy was so anxious to find her the theatrical venture was never
disclosed thanks to dorothys tact and abilities for she showed that
she could manage some things even better than could her cousins

well it was a glorious trip to buffalo after all was nats comment
as they neared north birchland

so it was agreed dorothy then she fell to wondering if she would ever
again have so many adventures little did she dream of what the future
held in store as will be related in another story which i shall call
dorothy dale and her chums

running some arent we said ned as the fire bird whizzed over the
country road

i i dont mind it faltered tavia then she turned to whisper to
dorothy i am so thankful to leave the that behind

dorothy only smiled but that smile showed that she understood perfectly
