questions do you define yourself as a member of a particular racial or ethnic group and if so what would you say that you are a member of a religious group if so what is there any other way that you think of yourself that you think influences your perspective on life before you went on the trip had you learned about the holocaust where or which sources how did this trip add to your information to your knowledge on a non cognitive or emotional level what do you know now that you did not know then did the visit to lututow change your understanding of the genocide if so how was the ceremony important in changing your understanding if so how did you find the interview with the elderly polish villager important to changing your understanding if so how did the visit to the lodz cemetery and the memorial change your understanding of the genocide if so how did the visit to auschwitz change your understanding of the genocide if so how include references to schindler s factory lublin itinerary not complete include any additional sites can you think of other experiences that influenced your understanding of the holocaust i never expected to see before you went on the trip did you have any images impressions of contemporary polish people if so what were they were these impressions changed on the trip if so how is there a nything in your family experience that you can connect to this experience before you went on the trip did you have particular images impressions of jews during the holocaust if so what have you ever had personal experience of anti semitism as a victim of it or seeing others engage in anti semitic acts what kind or did you then or now have trouble grasping what exactly people mean when they use the term anti semitic if you are not jewish what was your experience before this with jewish people is there anything in your own background that can help you connect with this experience this could be in regards to culture ethnicity religion were you a person of faith before this trip did this trip affect your faith or not in any way did this trip make you think about human evil in a new way did anything about the experiences on the trip with other participants with the poles we met and the sites we saw affect your understanding of inter religious or inter ethnic or inter racial relations has the trip changed you if yes how so although it happened a year ago do you find that you talk about the poland trip if you do in what way if you don t why do you think not do you have anything to add were there questions you thought i would ask that i didn t would you consider yourself more or less interested in poland than before you went on this trip would you consider yourself more or less sympathetic to the poles during wwii responses daisy mexican ethnically see myself and catholic i think that if i want something i can achieve it it has affected how i live and choices i make like the poland trip i ve never been out of the country was so appreciative i try to initiate things for myself i was very appreciative for the help i got to go thru readings in high school we read night so we talked about the holocaust a lot and thru schindler s list definitely you can read about it and can see it but when you re there it s completely different when you re there we were walking thru the warsaw ghetto just seeing how it was how many lived there it just changes everything cuz you feel bad when you read the stories but when you re there you think that it could have been my mom even though i m not jewish it touches me as a human being i also learned about the people who helped you hear about those who don t i think wow i wonder if i were in that situation if i would have done the same thing in warsaw ghetto lodz cemetery memorial in lodz we saw the scratches on the boards of the cattle cars and it was so hard at posnos cemetery i learned about putting rocks on grave it was so big and like a forest auschwitz that was probably one of the hardest things cuz one thinks of it when one thinks of auschwitz seeing the rooms of shoes we all fell apart it altered my understanding of the holocaust to see all the little kids stuff all the shoes understood the innocence more when we walked to the birkenau part the bathrooms it was shocking they had a better sense of surviving there cuz no one wanted to go near them other places i remember we went to a cemetery and met the old man who was years old jewish guy showed me how strong people are he told me how he escaped twice and how he is still there keeping up the cemetery selflessly was almost killed twice and came back after war only jew in village and takes care of cemetery the schindler factory was amazing how it was put together to see the papers of the restrictions jews couldn t do the place where they had to leave in a panic everytime i think about it things are no longer the same hearing now about the holocaust seeing the reality has changed my understanding completely i imagine the german soldiers coming close to me i became more identified with the people there you watch a movie you think that is horrible but it goes away this doesn t go away i imagined as i saw the different uniforms and the guns they used me and my friends imagined how it would feel to have them coming to you it stays with you trauma you get the two extremes how humans can be so horrible and so good too you watch a movie like schindler s list but gradually it leaves you this doesn t leave you i had no expectations i was clueless i had never been out of the country i was just open about poles not really a sense of the poles we had the tour guide but not really interact cultural festival very fun we interacted but not really in a close way they only tried out their english with us being looked at by other people discriminated against to some extent not being wanted just the immigrant situation not to the extreme but similar no witnessing of anti semitism did this make you more conscious of persectuon yes you just see how it was and like you see all the hatred against a certain group of people for no valid reason and you can connect it and can see how it happens not just to one group of people but to a bunch of groups of people you can see that connection and having experienced going to auschwitz you experience how powerful that was and you can only imagine how powerful it was for other people being that same thing so it makes everything more powerful of that destructive energy any contemporary association maybe anti muslim and people who are against them without knowing anything about them or the religion the jewish people on the trip explained things to us especially when we went to the synagogues meeting with chief rabbi it was amazing he pretty much welcomed us he told us about his synagogue his experience it was really cool because he is like an influential person yet he talked to us as an equal no sense about how important he was at dinner we sat with the people at the services these were poles and europe i met a french man and he spoke to me in spanish my parents are really catholic so i m a really strong catholic and it was interesting that there were so many catholics one of the things i remember the most one temple and two churches a catholic church and synagogue and were both burned out and had she talks about lublin story the connection between the two she retells the story your faith how could this happen it just really hard why didn t someone the church intervene but then you think about those that did help there s a lot of negative things going on and sometimes you think how could this happen there was one story when we went to the cemetery the really big one at lodz there were tombstones with clothes on them and it was the teenagers who survived the holocaust and then they were killed afterwards for being jewish it just that it made us all angry because they went through so much and then they were killed just for being jewish so that kind of shows the resentment that was still left after the kind of conflict even after the holocaust they had escaped that and were still hated i guess yes i don t think you can go somewhere like that and not be affected in any way it just makes you think how you connect and relate to other people i mean like going to csun there are so many people here that you don t even think about like their experiences it makes you think about human beings in whole different way cuz during the holocaust i guess it s just a lot of negative stuff but you think about people who did help you see the courage you the negative and the courage too especially when they didn t have to help they didn t have to do anything so now i think about going out of the way to help others without being asked i appreciate the good in a way i think about how people can be good person without being asked your faith how could this happen it just really hard why didn t someone the church intervene but then you think about those that did help there s a lot of negative things going on and sometimes you think how could this happen there was one story when we went to the cemetery the really big one at lodz there were tombstones with clothes on them and it was the teenagers who survived the holocaust and then they were killed afterwards for being jewish it just that it made us all angry because they went through so much and then they were killed just for being jewish so that kind of shows the resentment that was still left after the kind of conflict even after the holocaust they had escaped that and were still hated i guess i told all my uncles and aunts because no one has ever been out of the country so they wanted me to tell them all i showed them everything and told them stories i say she saw black hole of evil but she saw this white light around it too a voluntary light the entire event was over the line it happened and to that extreme by going there it deepened your visceral connection to the humanity of what happened it continues to grow hasn t shattered you but rather made you more sensitive to the pain of others and the goodness of others too you hear a lot about the holocaust here in california you are exposed to it holocaust you hear about it read about but you don t live it like some people did and i think that s really important and i know it s really hard but to make it real we think about it happening then but it is happening for people today and it s important to know that that it is real danielle i call myself jew ish i have had a bat mitzvah ceremony was confirmed belong to a temple and still celebrate certain holidays but to me those practices are more part of a cultural background than because of faith yes a large portion of my family was killed and or displaced during the holocaust and i have stories from the survivors mainly through my maternal grandmother hebrew school as well as secular school also discussed the subject at least once each year st grade college when reading about the subject in a book and maybe seeing a few pictures or visiting the local holocaust museums it is easy to detach to physically visit the location where such horrors took place is not as easy to have the privilege of actually seeing these places made what i have learned previously seem more concrete they re not just names and pictures in books and museums as mentioned before stories from my grandmother other family members and through school i really had no expectations or images before going my best friend as a kid once said i was going to hell and i had a classmate in high school who was surprised i didn t have horns that s about the extent of my experience no not really it just made it easier to picture the evil only if the subject comes up arthur we kind of started at if you want to fill in that above quite briefly i had thought of the holocaust as a great big thing associated with massive killing on a big scale i was never conscious of it on a local level just as when you watch a film that focuses on one family or character so too this experience focused on a particular place which made things more concrete yes the ceremony made me aware of the poles attitude i had never thought about the poles perception i am aware of how the poles have many layers talking to the polish survivors made me think about individual polish families it brought the holocaust to a local level i was aware of the unfinished memorials and how they captured the interruption into daily life caused by the war i can still picture the corpse preparation space in the chapel it is vivid and i was made aware by the plaques along the cemetery walls of how many people were trying to keep memory alive i found auschwitz to be not as compelling as other experiences because it was so mediated so much the museum however the gas chambers were powerful these couldn t be mediated couldn t be compromised the meeting with the university students in krakow was important it inspired me to know more about poland meeting polish citizens and just being in the country invested me in poland in ways i couldn t imagine before this visit an actual train car from the camps at the memorial in lodz the small town experience in lututow talking to people who witnessed what i didn t know graffiti in lodz and krakow the intensity of urban life in krakow majdanek its almost untouched nature a more authentic experience than auschwitz as well as seeing its closeness to lublin jewish kitsch jewish figurines being sold at marketplaces i had no thought about the poles before this trip i have an understanding now of how different contemporary poles are from those who lives during the war years i am aware now of how poles are interested in global capitalization it is a completely unexpected perception this trip gave me the awareness of how concerned and sad the common people are i see behind the facades the layers to the human aspect the trip made me want to be interested in my own past and look at the anti semitism in my life here arthur was your vivid description of the nazi graffiti and name calling you experienced in greenfield i think here with this remembrance maybe we can talk a bit more i m wondering how these memories of your own experiences with anti semitism have informed your work and thinking casually jewish reformed it brought more fully into consciousness the position of the bystander those who watch atrocities are there by accident and what their responsibility may be i tried to imagine the situation of the poles can we blame these people i began to empathize with people i had considered as the enemy i had grown up hearing that the poles were as bad as the germans my experience is growing on an ethical plane i compare it to other kinds of field trips like the birth right and march of the living trips they are similar in structure but this trip was more valuable i found myself attaching to a land that has been seen as evil unlike the other trips which focus on the evil on this trip we focused on the experiences that occurred here both those that were normal and those that were evil i think of a line what is it that love asks of the self but to forget the self one must leave the self behind to grow and learn this experience resulted in my stretching my self yes i am committed to understanding more what happened during that period i have also changed my career focus this experience is going to inform all i do including my relationship to my family how i experience and hear the stories of my grandfather the trip had the effect of making me us feel special it is a unique experience i will mention the trip in an off handed way as indicative of something that i have experienced that is special interesting i am proud of the trip it provides a deepening of character and color cherie african american christian as a woman mentally older than my age i m a year old woman but i feel i m a little bit older than because i m a mom i knew about holocaust cuz of our class and before i knew very little i pushed it away cuz it was about people dying and the way they died hitting a soft spot i avoided it and felt it was important to take a class and i signed up and i learned a lot more i was able to express myself more all the anger that i had not only about what happened but the historical event my own personal issues in experiencing the camps it all came out it allowed me to release my own feelings i m a person who likes to hold things in and this experience helped me to release some of that i found myself expressing more than i usually do especially around people lots of emotion in saying this i actually experienced by asking others as well a lot people thought only jews died there and they didn t know about the other groups about the gypsies and i learned about the other groups who learned detail about how they died the experimentation the other ways they died i felt uncomfortable being in a small village felt weird being there i noticed we were outsiders and everyone was starring at us i actually didn t feel comfortable being here so i didn t interview anywhere i left with kevin and we walked around and looked at the church the ceremony affected me when the mayor spoke and apologized and when you were talking it did because i have never been in a cemetery that made me feel like that the whole environment the way it wasn t kept up the different ages knowing the germans took the stones from cemeteries to make street made me get angrier about what happened saw nazis as devils made me see them as really evil it had the biggest impact on me because i am a mother and particular things i don t like to watch like on tv like talking about the end of the world or people killing other people so when i went to where people died and how it died it hit a soft spot that is hard to handle and hit me hard i worry and i know something like this won t happen but it is happening in other countries and made me think about my kids and touched me what if i died and they were on their own because i know that kids were left by their parents so i can t imagine mostly auschwitz i wasn t feeling good i got sick after that i had a back pain the stress really affected my immune system it was very hard for me to handle it made me very depressed so much evidence there i didn t know that i d see so much evidence i didn t know that at all and seeing all of that anyone can see all that evidence and that it did happen and to say it didn t happen is a lie it affirmed my sense of what happened evidence at auschwitz the hair the prosthetic limbs cities with names the actual cells where they were kept a room without window i could hardly breathe in there no after the trip i guess it was the controversy about poles being blamed or having responsibility for the jews dying i don t recall where we were when we discussed this at one of the university settings i learned about that i believe i have an idea i don t have much information about it but on my dad s family they were slaves and were killed as well one of my great great grandmas was married to a slave owner lots of my family died they were hung and shot i grew emotional connection with the jews cuz i m a black female who is christian i knew nothing about the jews or anything about them and now i have a sense about it and care more about it and relate my life and other school work and books a book i m reading right now about to the holocaust when i read about testimony and trauma and i link my ideas now to it i had no experiences with jewish people i knew very little about them and i knew very few jews it made me question my faith and even my grandmother thought the same thing how could god allow this happen to people yes how could a human kill another human for no good reason i kind of did not want to contribute to discussion cuz i didn t know as much as others i knew little about religions catholics etc it made me feel more open to other religions and cultures than mine which i know is a problem for me to open up to other types of people yes it might sound crazy but i care more and more about spending time with my kids i appreciate this more and love them more more relating what happened the holocaust to others i ask people now if they know about the holocaust and i don t think i would have done that before yes people talk about where they travel and i tell them i ve been to poland i talk about it as travel experience and i ask them if they know about the holocaust i educate others now and about hitler one year old student from kazastan and he didn t know anything about the holocaust his reason was we don t study jewish culture i started telling him about it i told how many people died there how it happened he didn t seem very interested but he knows now i had lots of obstacle to going so i felt tested yet i benefitted so much though it was a real trial now i care more about the issue cynthia before i didn t know but i ve done my research and i am polish and russian though my last name is indian from india i was a mormon for years that s how i did my genealogy i was raised as a conservative jew i m also lesbian and mom and a grandmother and these influence me learned about holocaust thru classes and first hebrew teacher was a survivor had tattoo on his arm my instructor for my bat mitzvah not just the cantor but mr weisman who taught me the entire service was also a survivor emotionally i have always been touched by the holocaust through people i knew but to actually have been there was an eye opener birkeneau made more of an impression on me than auschwitz and maybe because we went there so quickly and even though the tour guide was very informative but kirteneau when we walked into the barracks where they had the bathrooms you could smell stench in barracks and open pit toilets and it has been half a century you could still smell the stench it was very visceral so although i work in a hospital all those things they talk about when you read accounts like when they have diarrhea it became so much more real to me than just a story especially when we were there it was raining and it was cold you could feel it that s why i had to draw the picture cuz i couldn t put into words everything i was feeling but we were standing there and there was the smoke from the chimneys and here we were so that s why i had to draw i hadn t known had grasped the number of poles killed and the choices they didn t to have make they really didn t have a choice self preserveance kicks in preserving the lives of your children i don t know what choices i would have made i couldn t even begin to understand lututow i was affected because your family came from here it made it a concrete experience the fact there was no cemetery it reflected what happened all over where the nazis were on a small scale i multiplied this to other villages it was just amazing it was meaningful to speak to the older poles he was six years old and although the person who he knew who now lives in ny doesn t validate his concerns they were children and the views of children aren t the same scary for them to be that young he was a child scary for them and he still remembers the choices his older brothers had made in order to survive didn t have a choice to save jews that were that and besides the fact the village was mostly jews and so there were so few poles they couldn t intervene didn t realize before how helpless poles were like i didn t realize about auschwitz like that book i read about music but she talks about walking thru auschwitz and they were ignored wasn t until i was there that i realized the poles weren t there it was made of by germans my outlook has changed you read that the poles didn t care and it is more complex because you realize we ve been blaming the poles and it may not necessarily be so it was a big change in me it made a huge difference being there concretized all my knowledge of the holocaust and of poland see how more complex history is to blame poles changed ceremony i was struck by the very important people there govt officials and all the children and the mayor apologizing the kids had a tough time very human and normal behavior it was what kids do the teenage boys were throwing pebbles at the girls kind of very human you d see this any place very normal transcending all language all politics all religion it may not have been respectful it was what kids do i just felt here we are in this village and hearing about the holocaust and these kids made me think life goes on lodz cemetery my gosh to see trees growing out of gravesites burial plots unkempt cemetery with s of jews to show how long we were there and they were elaborate gravesites so if you didn t have money you couldn t build these so you saw their wealth and then the pits with horse radish growing i thought you couldn t get more appropriate spring bitter herbs growing throws new light on what i did know i hadn t been able to write poetry about this trip at all it gets more complicated the more i read but the trip throws a light on what is factual and not factual especially when it comes to people who are survivors i broke down when i saw the tiny baby shoes at auschwitz because my granddaughter was new and i thought about my baby granddaughter and this is where we lost it and the other reason cuz there is a iost a two year old who would have been a family member and when i saw that my imagination went rampant what if those had been her shoes my family didn t die in krakow they were moved around the countryside doing my genealogy but it was made more real being there especially seeing no jews in town of my family i saw a picture of the synagogue in the galicia museum poland as beautiful as it is and why poles ended in chicago area cuz it looks like that also didn t expect them to be so conscious of recycling but it makes sense to me cuz they recycle everything like our grandparents did during the war see generational division newer kids wear bright colors older poles more conservatively dressed i had family in krakow cuz of polish jokes it made me realize being here how intelligence poles were and how nazis needed to get rid of intelligentsia our families must have had lots of equality there in some places to be able to maneuver that way we did i understand why younger ones left to u s cuz they didn t inherit it changed my perspective of how my great grandparents came here i can relate to that where i grew up in south san gabriel valley i was born in chicago and originally lived behind cantor s on fairfax which was very jewish then my dad remarried my mom died and they bought their first house in south san gabriel i felt anti semitism we were the only jews on the block until th grade and other family came and linda and jimmy came in i was a girl scout and then i started hebrew school and i would wait for the bus to get us and i had to change my troop to different days there were two troops and wouldn t let me switch and i was the only jew in the troop and they wouldn t let me switch so i had to leave girl scouts and then in th grade i also got into fight with someone who was supposed to me my really good friend she called me a dirty jew and we got into on the playground i beat her up they left me alone after that but i got pulled into the principal s office i didn t get into trouble she did but that was the kind of thing and i knew i was jewish i ended up in junior high there were more jews but i still had to put up with a lot of stuff i went to granada hills high and a lot of jews and i wasn t the only one and i wasn t the only one i had been part of usy and then jim s mom my mother in law she was polish and had to check to see if i had horns she was from detroit chicago area then my dad had an exxon station in pico rivera cuz it was the only company that would let a jew buy so i had a lot of experiences faith didn t affect my faith i already knew it was a nazi initiative evil it was more poignant more visceral no other way to talk about it cuz we read about stuff living in america getting away with genocide ethnic cleansing when you read about it and the world looks on it really hits and reading about it what do you do yes i don t hate poles i had conversations with survivors at work about war they get so agitated they can t talk about it and i realized our education about the way we teach other jews about poles and what actually occurred is very different than the actuality so this continued hatred is someway a lot unwarranted not that i haven t experienced polish hatred in a personal way i realized it is not everybody that these are individual people yes i ve been changed i never thought i d be saying that i want to go back when i was there i kept saying i want to spend more time here i m not spending enough time i really want to go back it feels like a part of me is there if it weren t for the reality that i have kids here i probably could go back there and live i would try to recapture what judaism could be or was it s idealistic maybe it s not exactly like going to israel where you don t have to say you re jewish kind of the same idea here i have to walk around and say i m a lesbian cuz until i have the same equality i have to mention it i did feel a connection and no matter you were you could see that our people were there and the poles aren t trying to hide that fact if you figure on a small percentage intermarriage in a place where jews had been for almost years there must be a certain percentage of non jewish who have jewish blood and so we must have had a large influence they re starting to realize their history is tied with ours and not just the regular history but their intellectual history when you think about scientists artists if you think about it some of these people weren t even jewish but managed to influence the world from poland it s a learning curve for them and we need to make it a learning curve for us their intellectual history is woven with jews we talk about the trip all the time i d love to bike through there food should be a part of this process askanzsy jews knew the food food almost made it like home they were selling bagels on every single corner sarah i knew something about the holocaust before going i learned a lot about it in school and my dad loves watching documentaries on wwii and they usually talk about the holocaust being at the sites was a real eye opening experience i ve only seen films documentaries and photos these things can only go so far compared to the real thing when studying the holocaust they only can cover so much i knew some of the horrific things and i had no idea how much they did i heard about the ghetto and i had no idea that people were starving to death there i didn t know about the term muselman was when a person was dying they would fall to their knees and waver like a muslim man praying what i think that affect me the most was the gravesites because i didn t know that the nazis destroyed them i think now i have a better understanding of the holocaust than before and how people view it i would tell some people about the trip and they would be interested while others wouldn t want to hear because it s so depressing i think i am more willing to hear people s life stories and try to understand them better i think every place and person has a story to tell there were some members in my group that could related to everything because they had family that survived or perished during the holocaust however i couldn t really relate only really empathize or image my relatives that i know of who fought in the pacific and i have only a small fraction of myself that is european i would like to say that my relative joined the u s army because of the horrific things that the nazis were doing but that s not true my grandfather joined because he wanted to defend his country philippines from the japanese however it was still terrible to hear what happened to all those people i found it fascinating to hear about what happened to the catholic priests i m not catholic but my parents grew up catholic i was raised to have respect for the catholic church i do think it was sad to what happened to them however some of them did do some horrible things that cost them their life and saved others stacy defines self as jewish lesbian i tend to see things from a jewish perspective first learned about holocaust thru films and listening to survivors speak in religious school first experience at or years old was my first exposure about holocaust trip for me added to my emotional knowledge i definitely experienced intense emotion on a deep level on the trip the other stuff i knew or heard about but the emotional knowledge was new different things during the trip touched me on a very deep emotional level learned about poland is a very beautiful country rich history and because of invasions diverse make up people in poland are workers farmers agricultural poor in a way we aren t in u s there s poverty in the u s but it felt different there they aren t used to having a lot of they use what they have other thing i learned was from my experience with poles very friendly generous warm and that was in contrast to what i had heard about them that they were very anti semitic my experience was that when they found out i was jewish they weren t anti semitic but wanted to learn more were curious wanted to know why i was there lututow on the cemetery and elderly survivors one thing that struck out for me was mayor did apologize i didn t expect that i also was surprised by how everyone came out to the ceremony and were so serious about it i thought they d poo poo it off but that s not what they did they were very much aware this was the history of their town and that there town was not what it was years ago elderly poles i wasn t in on that lodz cemetery that was a very emotional day just seeing the extent of the shoah i knew that the lodz ghetto was there and that they had died in the ghetto and that ghetto dead was in the lodz ceremony what affected me was how much a jewish community presence was there how many centuries of jews had lived there made their life there had thrived there and then the size of the cemetery i had no idea how large it was and it was now just gone auschwitz i think how it changed my understanding is that i thought the camps were jewish and not jewish and that there was this other in seeing how many others died there so many poles killed there too that things were brutal for poles and poles were singled out the fact that they would arrest a person s family and bring them to the camps that sort of changed it for me that it was just as brutal for the poles under the nazi regime as for the jews the lublin experience i realized that the poles need for history what life was like for people see how he had created the town etc i think that poland wants to do this in general they don t have a history they ve been denied their history it is hopeful poland wants to do that beauty of poland it is beautiful in a way that israel is like i imagine the garden of eden like its greenness the smell of air blueness of sky it s a very earthy sentiment type of place and the other thing was that there are jews there now that they are trying to grow and thrive trying to establish themselves and move forward from now on in spite of everything that happened that was very hopeful my mother s father was from odessa russia and i kept thinking i probably had relatives that were in poland during and after the holocaust or before the holocaust who then came to the u s because i know that the boundaries of poland kept on changing so i would like to do more research and find out what happened to them i grew up in la and then san diego as a child i didn t have any specific instances of anti semitism or being singled out for being jewish but i was in midwest during many summers and the midwest may as well be a different planet than calif my father converted because we were jewish his family had never met any jews before you know with horns on our head was restrained about us the midwest is that way everything is black and white literally blacks lived in one side of town and the whites in the other and the jews usually lived in the white section they saw us as other i never had a personal experiences i remember that my family was frum and we were reformed and that was more of an issue on faith i walked away with this feeling more strongly about my judaism than before because i realized the blame was with nazis they did what they did for me god was not in the equation my faith wasn t tested that way more i realized human cruelty it s one thing to read about it but to actually be at those places in auschwitz birkeneau or the monument of tombstones certain things were really hard to grasp not only did the nazis pillage all the cemeteries and take out all stones and then had the evilness to actually use them to line the streets that really made me aware of the extent of how much evil there was it brought it out in sharp relief that these things are still here not that any of that has gone away the strife between jews and others of other races made me aware of how conflict still exists everywhere made me sensitive to the suffering that continues to exist it changed me on an emotional level it s something i won t ever forget for the rest of my life and it will still come in waves and hit me i actually want to go back to poland not sure when like to do more family searching i talk about things i remember something will arise and i ll talk about it feeling and dreams come up my emotions still strong i still have dreams about it being on the trip it comes and goes in waves it was so intense that years ago i would have thought my trip to israel was very intense that was a totally different thing but this was so intense for me going to poland was way more intense than going to israel there is so much of a presence of jews historically in poland about trip at varying points more debriefings tiara jackson yes i am african american christianity yes my nurturing that provided morals and values as well as religious beliefs yes all through high school and through current american jewish literature at csun this trip particularly gave me an emotional scare about war in response to the notion of being evil i do know that the world really can be evil seeing the aftermath i always had the notion that maybe it can be fake or this is made up it did not change my perspective it is still wrong and still evil it s one thing to see pictures and move on with your life it s like how we watch the news with all the tragedy going on in the world it s hard to fathom it longer than a few minutes because we have become desensitized but the fact i got to walk on the same ground that someone from the holocaust just made me have a different perspective i still can t get over it that i walked on those grounds sat in the grass they died in were shot in yes we went to the katyn massacre convention held at the radogoszcz prison and they had many books and articles about the katyn massacre it showed just pure genocide within the prison systems it let me know that even in prison no one was safe not just at the camps lodz cemetery the holes in the ground that were intentionally dug buy the people who later occupy them i could not imagine digging my own grave honestly i just knew the place would be so beautiful how could beauty be so evil something i will never understood the most beautiful people and places have such dark secrets dark past that are full of stains yes i will never look at war the same i feel all war is someone else s genocide i am african american slavery is a serious connection to this i am not a jew but i have had the notion of discrimination when i was in poland some of the polish people well the older generation didn t take to me well i got cursed in polish looked at in such devious manner by the elders but the younger the generation was infatuated with me i really did not have any experience with the jewish community my culture being african american i have learned about slavery all my life and sensitized me to be able to cope with what i learned and saw yes i was a person of faith before it made me closer to god in the sense of praying that something like the holocaust would never happen again but it is yes i did as i have stated all acts of war are an evil deity that spreads like an epidemic i do not understand what can make someone go to that extreme yes it let me know that polish elders still view life in a binary it s black and white or one or the other so i had to be nice to the bad looks and frowns i got for being black and possibly overweight no i m still the same me just a bit more educated i talk about it usually in world politics conversations that i frequently have it just seems pertinent to bring it up krystal brooks black and or african american prefer black given civil rights connotations not any particular group more educated you become the more religious you become i identify raised baptist jehovah s witness family history rare open mindedness epitome of history major not as objective with historical periods relating to your life or are personal to me yes elementary school standard history curriculum my family would compare the african american plight with jewish suffering as well as that of other groups ap history on wwii literary perspective from dr clark s class didn t become real to me until i saw the personalized stories and dramatizations in english class face to face confrontation participation with real events it made me more culturally informed sound becoming more sensitive aware and empathetic the atrocities of war what the landscape looked like grounds new learning yes it showed a modern consequence of what we were studying once there were jews to none today not so much in understanding the history but it was in understanding the personal feelings and victims less developed or less industrialized than many small towns in the us my understanding of the events was clear the interviews helped actualized the events in concrete details and living history first hand experience was more moving than a textbook how strange and foreign it was to see a polish man live with a lot of jews and jewish friends and then live without them it took the man years to process that sudden change i understood the annihilation of the jews as more mechanical and industrialized to compare to slavery it was conducted over a long period of time and conducted for labor purposes primarily the cemetery drove him for me this distinction this forced me to put myself in the shoes of these victims to finish their story or recall it for the first time the memorial wasn t as surreal or intense as auschwitz or other sites of the holocaust though the books of all the names of victims made me see the holocaust as more dehumanizing than i thought the jail within the camps the sheer size and the emphasis on children and their belongings were all shocking to me to make the distinction between concentration camp labor camp death camp was invaluable one of the punishments was for prisoners to stand all night in a tiny cell and work all day until dying of exhaustion the gas chamber was particularly powerful as the tour guide told us stories about throwing babies into that chamber for an aspiring mother or for anyone else this was terrible to hear the way society had commercialized the holocaust learning about it from american education was a revelation compared to polish understanding carts advertising salt mines auschwitz as if they were on the same level it was sold as an attraction rather than a historical landmark mainstream society is careful to question that commercialization this was very interesting to witness in the jewish quarter and elsewhere a room with kilotons of human hair shocking this was a whole other level of dehumanization and commercial exploitation using body parts to sell africans so much rain the land was impossibly green i have lived in the city my whole life all small businesses lack of department stores the condition and planning and lack of infrastructure in the town of lodz didn t hear anything about them they had pale skin i knew that before i went didn t realize the holocaust was so integral to poland that so many of the jews came from there how diverse it was was surprising they were often hospitable traditional and used to their way of life i m the only one in my family to travel abroad distant oppression and slavery way way back my impression was that jews were average middle class citizens there are always exceptions i just assumed they would fit in and be assimilated i ve heard of racial epithets but that s my only experience with anti semitism anti semitic for me aligns with hateful is judaism a religion or race this is always a big question so i ve had no religious experiences with jews but i have with racial jews i was not a particular person of faith and the trip didn t change my faith really i had already seen a lynching museum which already made me feel people could be that cruel i had already been exposed to these kind of inter faith inter racial situations yes it changed the way i look at the world at history and humankind it also changed the way i approach travelling as a form of education and comprehensive life event rather than as tourism or vacation i talk about it all the time it really opened my eyes liz helton no i don t yes christian i come from a slightly privileged generation and maybe even racial religious background at least according to my mom yes i learned about it in generic ways from different books i read from movies and from my research paper for dr clark s class on american culture and the holocaust specifically i had known that when stalin came into poland he treated polish war heroes differently than average citizens i researched a female catholic social worker who saved a lot of polish jews from persecution before going to poland i felt that the holocaust was one of the darkest periods in human history and that america likely should have stepped in before pearl harbor my visit to auschwitz added an immediate emotional level it felt like an outside haunted house you could really feel the horror that hapenned there just how far poland has come since the war how much of the history was preserved was surprising the preservation of the architecture in krakow stood out especially i was glad we spent more time in krakow than in warsaw which felt pristine and new you couldn t tell that anything happened hearing a first hand experience was important and made me know more about what actually happened rather than anything based on books i had read or movies i had seen understanding smaller immediate and local details added a new dimension for me i had only heard about polish people who didn t like jews here in lututow i learned that the poles treatment of jews in the war was more complicated and varying than i thought they were also more victimized than i realized this town definitely changed my perspective of the holocaust this was an important experience groundbreaking what was most surprising was all of the schoolchildren not paying attention whether they were distracted or didn t realize what was really going on it was sort of heartbreaking to see them out of touch with their heritage part of the reason i realized was that teachers parents institutions might not be doing their job to teach these children about the history of their town perhaps in other places the holocaust was more recognized and appreciated but in this town the lack of understanding stood out this conversation definitely changed my respect for the polish experience it made me realize that there were also a lot more people out there against the jews than most people are aware of it makes things a little more real and authentic when you see half open graves ready to throw human bodies into the fallen apart the cemetery and the cordoned off areas of the cemetery felt closer to the devastation than a museum for instance this visit made me feel like something is in the process of happening rather than a finished result this visit also made this period more real to me i could still feel the death and the pain and agony in the building and on the grounds of the camp museums and artifacts in krakow and warsaw esp from that era really drove home a broader perspective of the genocide the luggage shoes hair and individual belongings at auschwitz all of the things that you realize have lost their owners and will never be returned so many of the buildings that were still standing and in good condition including the buildings that withstood bombings and fires etc none at all i had no resources or reason to have an impression a lot of them were very friendly and nice and helpful i had a relative in wwi a nurse who helped injured polish soldiers from france i believe back to poland she was a martyr who was killed for heroic actions i knew about the historic impression propaganda manufactured by the nazis that jews are stupid deserve to be killed cheap etc i ve had no experience of anti semitism i knew one jewish girl in high school we always got along really well and became friends historically my religion was persecuted as well as the jews during the spanish inquisition for instance it was heartbreaking to know that all these people died it may have grounded me more in my faith it did not make me question my spirituality or faith my faith is human that people have fundamental good within them yet they are able to be turned another way entirely mainly that this is still going on today poles have moved on fairly successfully since the war the country seems to make the holocaust a part of it and they are not bogged down by their past i now question the media portrayals of the holocaust a lot more i have not really talked to my family about the trip but i talk about it most with people who i travelled with whenever we get together new memories come back to me and surprise me this is a unique experience that we shared and continue to process i am more interested in poland today than i was before i went also i am more sympathetic to the poles during the war than i was before i left rachel silverman american white jewish female being a student affects my views i am exposed to younger generations and exposed to different and experiences and generations as compared to those who are working and in the world and learning about different people and cultures and views makes my perspective different from those who may already be in the world and thus maybe more close minded i learned a lot about the holocaust during the period of my confirmation after my bat mitzvah we had to go thru a year confirmation class and one of the years was about the holocaust so the entire year was spent watching holocaust movies reading holocaust books discussion the holocaust going to the museum of tolerance so that entire year on thursdays we would talk about the holocaust and discuss it so i have that prior knowledge and then also i had taken some classes in college before i went on the trip although it was not an extensive study there were sections about it so that i had studied it academically as well going to poland had a bigger affect on me because being there was different than reading about it or seeing it in movies or whatever and seeing that firsthand experience by walking thru the camps specifically auschwitz one of the parts that really got me was walking in the room that had all the cut hair in the glass case and inside of it was little girls braids that really got to me and made the holocaust not necessarily more real but had a more deep connection to me than before i think that when you study the holocaust generally it is always about what happened to the jews what happened to the jews but going there you realize that it is a lot more than just what happened to the jews but it happened to other people as well and you kind of skim over that because all discussion of the holocaust is fixed on the million jews but you learn that it wasn t just the jewish people who were ostracized and affected by this also learning about that after the war that the nazis blew up a bunch of gas chambers i had not really learned about that because we really don t study about what happened at the end except about the liberation and then everyone is happy cynically said but at the end you really don t know what happened so going thru auschwitz and seeing all the gas chambers and barracks and where people slept and then were destroyed really showed that they wanted to hide what they were actually doing and that was really interesting to me they knew it was wrong the schindler s factory was interesting cuz it was interactive and had an impact you had to take things in but the interactive feeling was really nice cuz you learn in a way that is emotional but allows you to learn and take in more cuz more user friendly another camp with separate buildings and one with one barn space filled with children s shoes it really got to us and then there was a wall with lights going on and off with names on it sort of interactive and it really got to us lodz cemetery we were walking around and it was nice because although we were being guided it was nice because we also had the opportunity to roam around although i didn t know anyone walking around and looking at the names and seeing certain tombstone feeling nature and god and life and death in one because all the jewish cemeteries are covered by growth and although it is sad it is also reassuring that life returns and there is going to be growth and is that sort of life after death kind of thing and also there was the ghetto field and we walked thru that path and one of the most touching things was that we all collected there and three of us said the mourning kaddish just reciting the kaddish for those people was a really touching moment in that field to see we were in the bus and helen decided to detour and we stopped in front a yeshiva that was being rebuilt and there were gates around it like construction don t enter and we were kind of roaming around the fence and found an entrance and the head of the construction workers was there and allowed us to come in and for some reason the guy who was heading the rebuilding was there and was going to give us a tour we went in there and it was like a two or three story yeshiva that was being rebuilt inside in the middle of the second floor there was like when you go to orthodox temples there is instead of a bema a table in the middle and the arc in front of it and standing in front of the table and knowing that great jewish scholars had been there and the sidderim on the walls and just touching them and the people that were mentioned were all these great rabbis and being there and being able to connect with that it was really touching and also we went to another one in krakow where there was a non jewish man who was rebuilding a very small synagogue that had the old parchments and the yods it was so touching that a non jewish man was putting so much effort into rebuilding this repainting doing all these things by himself and when we were in there standing there at that moment in the center of that room with that table in the middle and knowing that great scholars had been here this was something i had not expected to see when going to poland i expected to see young poles how they live how they eat the cemeteries concentration camps but i never expected to have that connection with great rabbinic scholars in this way it is concrete touching the wood feeling the sidderim knowing these great scholars had touched these same books really brings to life traditional judaism people before you had really done this it is a tradition and has been passed down from family to family everyone whether from poland or not has these things in common a connection to something from the other side of the world something i had not expected i didn t really have impressions of polish people beforehand except they didn t speak english but i found that most of them did speak english i really didn t have a thought about how they looked at or how they were because i was a jewish studies major and not a history major like many of the other students i hadn t done much research about poland and in all honesty when they were talking about the history of poland other than about the jews and the holocaust i was clueless but regarding the non jews poles jews recovering their judaism she recounts being with rabbi shuddrich and hearing his story about the skinhead who discovers he is jewish and become very orthodox pious devout even within poland finding out jewish heritage even changes the poles and changes the image of what poland is when we saw a memorial statue and behind it is the building of a new museum and yet they were taking away something that had been there before and it was an kind of up and down experience you re doing something great and yet you re also taking away something that was special in itself me she sees colliding of historical moments complexity of history my grandparents were from russia but all were here before the war my images of jews in the holocaust i had those images that we all have seen of the piles of bodies and the jew with the yellow star the images that are shown to you were preset in my life anti semiticism i felt really where i grew up there was only one private high school and it was catholic she recounts feeling different because she couldn t go to that school and she recounts being told terrible jokes about jews and then in the dorm she has an experience with a friend who gets drunk sees her star of david necklace and says he wants hitler to come back and kill the jews so today there is still anti semitism whether people think so or not it s kind of interesting for me because i had thought of myself as a reformed jew but as time progressed i considered myself to be more conservative i began going to chabad more and i really like that kind of judaism but also reformed judaism and then i went to poland and although i consider myself a religious jew i didn t keep kosher or the sabbath just being there feeling those feelings i m not sure it absolutely changed me but it could have changed me now i look at myself now i m different i m not sure if my current state is part of a progression of change or if it was ignited by the trip but i have become more observant before college i didn t have a kosher home during the trip i found myself wanting to keep kosher and wanting to keep the sabbath and on saturday morning i almost walked in the rain in warsaw to go a mile to the temple and before in america i would have said no i m not doing that now i walk miles to go to shul and that is something before i wouldn t have done and i don t know if it was the trip but it was part of my observance change touching those texts and feeling the scholars had a touching effect on me yes obviously i think though that after studying the holocaust and human nature i think people do what they have to do to survive and sometimes people think they have to do whatever to survive i also think of people who have survived and she recounts story of father and son where one dies and other keeps the bread it is so hard to imagine being in that situation people had to do what they had to do to survive so although there were evil men i don t believe that all germans were evil they were doing what they had to do to survive it is complicated she sees blurring of good and evil similar to idea of grey zone hitler was obviously an evil person taking advantage of the world but not all the people who were under his command were evil they may have been trying to protect their family etc there really is no clear cut answer of what is good or evil but there is a real sense of what good and evil too i think it was interesting i saw more nuns than i had ever seen that poland is catholic and that the jewish community and cultural center is not run by jews and that brotherhood amongst all the people helping each other out is really touching and seeing that happen really moved me loving thy neighbor as myself really is the truth i now question the media portrayals of the holocaust a lot more i do share it with people it is also part of my resume and i speak about the greater knowledge the feeling that i have and i share my experience with those students who will be going this coming summer too it comes up a lot in conversations going to poland was a really special experience i exposed myself to the dark tragic part of our past as well as the future and the future of the jewish community in poland and i also want to mention the krakow festival and how big a part of the trip that touched me i really felt that it was amazing it was happening in poland and that it was run by people who were not jewish and that the jcc in poland connected to the jcc in america and i met a couple there with whom i had email connection it was a touching part of my story how people are trying to rebuild the jewish community michael no i would define myself as jewish no yes i first had encountered studying the holocaust in middle school in class i believe we read night that was my first real encounter of learning about the holocaust but besides that occasionally i read through high school and in college being an historian it was definitely something of interest to me given my heritage i did encounter before the trip the trip for me did have a big impact i didn t have as much an emotional reaction as many of the students many of them were brought to tears for me it was something i processed more on a cognitive level but on an emotional level it definitely did hit me and touched me but very privately i feel it is kind of hard to talk about this that the history as it is told is somewhat lopsided and that there is a lot of blame attributed to the polish people and what i learned is that there was a lot of balance that was able to come out in the process of exploring the history which i really appreciated trying to be objective it was learning that there were people who were complacent there were people who actually helped the nazis carry out their mission and there were a lot of people who didn t fit into either of these categories didn t want them there stood up for what was right and resisted
