the awakening fle rough draft


in the novella the awakening by kate chopin the protagonist edna is not courageous in mademoiselle reiszs eyes she tries to emulate mademoiselle reiszs idea of what real courage is by killing herself but in her heart she knows that this final act is not courageous  she has a commitment to her children and her husband that she is completely disregarding she is not trying hard enough to meet the standards expected of her by society and mademoiselle reisz  if she had really worked to fight her love for robert or her desire to be away from her husband and children then mademoiselle reisz would consider her courageous
in life edna does not fulfill mademoiselle reiszs definition of what it is to be courageous  mademoiselle reisz tells edna her idea of what it is to be courageous the first time edna visits her after they meet on grand isle courageous ma foi the brave soul the soul that dares and defies  when mademoiselle reisz says dares and defies it could be interpreted two ways  we could assume it means to dare and defy others and the standards set for her in the victorian era or it could mean to dare and defy oneself  if it means the former edna is defying others but not daring  to defy would simply mean that she is challenging the way the world works by doing anything other than what is considered normal for her class and gender and age which includes doing nothing and rejecting the world as she currently is  but daring involves some sort of action taking place  edna is not doing anything actively but instead she is being passive by refusing to participate in normal life and not replacing that life with another if mademoiselle reisz means the latter edna is neither daring nor defying herself  defying herself would mean not doing exactly what she wants to do and since all edna wants to do is reject the world and surrender to her own loneliness she is not defying herself and again daring involves an active life and daring herself would mean that edna did something new or challenged herself to continue life the way it used to be daring yourself and defying yourself is what truly makes a person brave  edna wants to abandon her husband abandon her children and run away with robert  but the truly courageous thing for her to do would be to challenge herself her desire to have an affair with robert and to escape from her husband and family fighting against herself would be the brave thing to do
mademoiselle reisz knows that abandoning her duties is not the definition of an artist also during their first meeting since grand isle mademoiselle reisz tells edna what she thinks of her supposedly being artist painting laughed edna i am becoming an artist think of it ah an artist you have pretensions madame  mademoiselle reisz knows that what edna is doing is not courageous or the work of a real artist  if edna worked through her struggles and stayed with her family and felt real anguish then she would have courage and be a true artist her paintings would show real emotion if she felt the pain of continuing her life as it was before she met robert and fell in love  instead her paintings are an escape not an expression of her true emotions or pain
edna knows that killing herself is cowardly by mademoiselle reiszs definition of courage but she does it anyway at the very end of the novel when edna is swimming out to sea she thinks of what mademoiselle reisz would say to her how mademoiselle reisz would have laughed perhaps sneered if she knew and you call yourself an artist  what pretensions madame the artist must possess the courageous soul that dares and defies edna realizes at the very end of her life that what she is about to do is not courageous at all but cowardly she says that mademoiselle reisz would have sneered at this act because she is not resisting her emotions and challenging herself but taking the easiest escape
edna by killing herself is not fulfilling mademoiselle reiszs image of what it is to be a true courageous artist to be an artist one must dare and defy which edna would be doing in challenging herself to love her husband a man she has no feelings for  because of this mademoiselle reiszs would consider robert to be a far more artistic person than edna because he challenges himself something mademoiselle reisz sees as essential to being an artist  he goes to mexico overcome his feelings for edna and on his return attempts to avoid her so he can resist his feelings  however edna allows herself to wallow in her depression and does not try to end her love for robert  because of this she does not possess the courage to become an artist while robert does
